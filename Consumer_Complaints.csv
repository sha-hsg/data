549162,Credit card,"I recently opened an account with citi simplicity and made a balance transfer to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The representative I spoke with, apparently mailed the check to the wrong address. I was told it was mailed on XXXX/XXXX/2015. 10 days have passed, the transfer was still not processed. I kept calling citibank for an update they keep saying it should be posted soon. Today, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify if they have received the check. Still no check up to date, they advised me to ask citibank what address the check was mailed to, because they might have mailed it to a wrong address. So I called citibank to verify the address they mailed the check to, and indeed, the check was mailed to the wrong address. Now they have to cancel the transfer and wait 2-4 business days for the completion of cancellation, and then wait another 7-10 days to receive the check. Which now puts me to another 2weeks of waiting. I asked them to trace the check to see if they can forward the check to the right address, but I got no help. 7-10 days processing turned into a month of processing. It was their fault at the first place for not verifying the correct address. But now I 'm the one who 's receiving all the inconvenience. They should have a way to expedite the process for inconvenience like this. But I did not get the help that I need."
567811,Debt collection,"A claim was filed on the original creditor XXXX XXXX for breach of contract, the vendor agreed to settle the dispute for {$240.00} per the resolution terms through the XXXX. Perfection Collections provided no written notice that this was referred to their offices. I learned of the issue because of credit file alert on XXXX/XXXX/16. I contacted the debit collection agency to try and get information. I was accused of ignoring the debit and not paying my bills. The operator XXXX XXXX was extremely unprofessional and he pushed my buttons. I was ultimately able to learn that debit was reported for {$1800.00}, not the original settlement amount of {$240.00} to end the contract. I also learned that that XXXX XXXX provided them with an incorrect contact information. This was the original reason for the breach of contract with XXXX XXXX. This is not the first time that this company has referred this issue to a debt collection agency after settling the debit through the claim with XXXX. 

I will obtain a copy of the filing with XXXX ... this can be supplied at a later date."
524772,Debt collection,"Disregard the above paragraph, none of your choices fit. We sold our home on XXXX/XXXX/2016, and BMO was paid off by the closing agency.

221351,Consumer Loan,"I was financed by Toyota financial services XXXX@22.9 % interest my credit score at the time was XXXX and so was my cosigner low XXXX 's. the terms of the loan were for 60 months, I asked for a simple interest loan. I was told if I paid early my money would apply towards the principal balance, that did not happen, all my payments were applied mainly to interest and a very small portion to principal. During the course of my loan I did take XXXX deferments with the understanding that they would be added to the end of my loan. So my maturity date would have been XX/XX/XXXX but it ended XX/XX/XXXX. 
So each month I was paying a little more than the balance due to help prevent further interest charges, but I did not see any benefit during the life of my loan. 
Every statement did not have any late fees or "" other charges '' due on my statements, then I look at my final payment on XXXX/XXXX/16 for {$3900.00}, I was appalled. Where did those charges come from? 
I inquired with Toyota Financial and they advised it was from my XXXX deferments, and interest during that time. 
{$3900.00} in interest and fees? That is unfair, unreasonable, deceptive and predatory. 
I have asked three times for my payment history and have not received it. 
I took out a loan to pay my final payment of {$3900.00} because I did not want my account to charge off or to not receive my title."
455688,Debt collection,"This company continues to report on my credit report after I sent them a letter telling them that this account was not mine and I have no idea what it is or who it belongs to! 

I asked for proof of a signed contract, I asked for a license to collect in my state, I asked for copies of all information referenced for this debt and still to date, I have not received anything but harassment from this company! 

THIS IS NOT MY DEBT! 

I WANT THIS ACCOUNT REMOVED FROM MY CREDIT REPORT AND THIS COMPANY TO STOP CONTACTING ME IMMEDIATELY!"

'' Yet, he REFUSED to provide me with any tracking information and refused to refund the money, which is not much. But I believe these are shady business practices.

117564,Credit reporting,Opened an account with XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX -- they back dated this account to my member service date of XX/XX/XXXX -- this account has been reporting an opening date of XX/XX/XXXX for the past XXXX years -- just recently for no explained reason trans union reported closing this account dated XX/XX/XXXX and opening a new account dated XX/XX/XXXX -- same account! This dropped my credit score XXXX points -- called XXXX and they said it should reflect an opening date of XX/XX/XXXX -- they said i needed to dispute with trans union.
38038,Credit reporting,"Transunion charged my credit card without my knowledge or consent. They charged my card 22 months at XXXX a month. At no point did I agree to pay them. Their month charges costs me over limit fees, interests costs, and they refused to fix this problem. The manager said that they will make a note on the account to not make any refunds. I believe that I am a victim of a scam. Transunion should not have been charging my card for any reason."
750068,Debt collection,"Professional Credit Management of XXXX, AR ( PCM ) intentionally and illegally reported and continues to report false information to Equifax. I had a procedure in XXXX of XXXX. They originally reported the date of first delinquency as XXXX of XXXX, three months prior to the date of service. Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) they must report accurate to the credit bureaus. I have their manager, XXXX XXXX, on a recorded call stating that they do indeed report false information so the information will come off sooner. Reporting false information is still illegal. Since then, PCM has reported the debt as unpaid when it has been paid and now they 've changed it again. In the last 2 months PCM has reported several different false reports, defamed my character, and jeopardized my ability to get sound interest rates. PCM should be shut down immediately and required to cease operations. I am also asking the CFPB to do a full audit of PCM."
141182,Credit card,"I was charged a late fee for paying too early. In XXXX 2015, I made a credit card payment to Capital One. The payment arrived at Capital One on my statement closing date, so instead of applying it to the correct statement, they applied it to the previous statement and declared me past due when the payment due date arrived. I was charged a late fee and had my account suspended even though I paid EARLY!"

Their continued text messages and voice mails - which cost me $ $ $ to receive - are annoying, and having my credit card turned down is embarrassing and completely unnecessary. 

I have asked them several times, through the message center of their web sites and via phone, not to contact me about a {$1.00} charge at XXXX XXXX. A customer service rep with whom I spoke said that she would put a note on my account not to contact me about such charges. Obviously, either she did n't put the note, or nobody bothers to read it. 

I have made numerous purchases of a much larger dollar amount at various stores and online, which they have not flagged as potential fraud. Yet at various XXXX XXXX stores, when I make a puny purchase, they decide it looks suspicious. Do they really think a scammer would steal my credit card just for {$1.00}?"
369466,Debt collection,I have been receiving threatening phone calls from Windham Professionals despite the fact that my XXXX account is paid and up to date.

149234,Mortgage,"Due to XXXX, XXXX & loss of jobs we could not make our house payment. We had a loan with XXXX and a XXXX loan with XXXX XXXX ( {$25000.00} ). We talked to our realtor who said to do a shortsale. She listed in XX/XX/XXXX at {$85000.00} ( XXXX shortsales in the neighborhood ). We received {$120000.00} which the buyer agreed to. She waited a month then terminated because she found another house that was not in shortsale. The house went back on the market and we received an offer XX/XX/XXXX for {$120000.00}. On XXXX XXXX notified us that the servicing of our loan was being transferred to Bayview Loan Servicing LLC on XX/XX/XXXX. But then moved it back further to XXXX. So we could not do anything during that time. Since we have been working with Bayview we had XXXX different negotiators in 5 months. We have had a qualified buyer since XXXX who still wants the house. Bayview has had an investor who still to this day has not said yes or no to the loan ( XX/XX/XXXX ). This company has called and harassed us and more important has called and harassed our parents who have nothing to do with our loan. If they needed paperwork XXXX has everything they need. She has been working on this offer for 8 months along with our Realtor. XXXX had been calling our Realtor each week to make sure the house was in pending and still going through. On XXXX our Realtor went to check on the house and found a flyer on the window from XXXX saying they were going to board the house up and change the locks. Our Realtors sign was out front in plain sight and had a sign saying "" contract pending '' along with a lockbox for agents to get in. She went to XXXX and tried to find out what was going on. She did have a loan officer call someone to notify them the house was in pending. Bottom line is we have had a qualified buyer for over 5 months and the offer is being sat on! They could have their money and we could sell the house."
458096,Student loan,"I am having a difficult time paying my student loans, through Navient, so I put in for a income driven payment plan, and the result was I had to pay {$0.00} last year for my loans, but the interest would still accumulate but I could make interest payments if I wanted to. I am doing this off of the top of my head, so XX/XX/XXXX when that year ended, I had to send in my income tax papers, and I will say here, I made {$24000.00} XX/XX/XXXX, so they based my payments from that. So they expect me to make payments of {$69.00} a month, let me tell you this, I am a XXXX year old widow, who has electric heat as a heat source, works part time at {$13.00} an hour as a XXXX, I drive a vehicle that is 17 years old and I also had to pay {$56.00} a month for that stupid Obama care insurance that I did not use. 
First I get a notice that I have a payment due of {$240.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, got paperwork in for the income driven then they modified the payment, and also changed the date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
Is there any way your agency can help me?

15312,Student loan,"This is the second time this has happened. I successfully reapplied for my Income Based Repayment through XXXX, and thought that I was all set to stay on my Income Based Repayment plan. For a reason unbeknownst to me, I have been removed from that plan and told to reapply, and so my accrued interest has been immediately capitalized, and I have been moved to a flat payment where the payment amount is so high and causes a financial hardship. The first time this happened, in XXXX, the customer service representative put me into forbearance and told me that they never received my income documentation that I had sent. It then took Navient 3 months to get me back on the plan ( original complaint filed XXXX XXXX, finally placed on plan in XXXX XXXX ). This time, I have not been able to speak to customer service, and do not want to go into forbearance, so I will have to make this payment while trying to get back on the plan. But I will have had the interest capitalized, which ads to the hardship."
270184,Debt collection,"This company calls me 20 times a day from different numbers throughout the ALL US States, NOT just CA. I was hospitalized and they were told not to call, yet continued to call daily. They record ALL conversations without notifying the caller, and in CA that is not legal. They call before XXXX, and after XXXX. This is all harassment and they do not care."
672067,Credit reporting,The reason I am complaining to day is because I went to XXXX XXXX union to close on a loan and when they went to establish membership for me and got a copy of my chexsystems file they denied me based on information that they received from Chexsystems. XXXX is saying that there is an account with XXXX XXXX reporting a {$52.00} charge off. I have never conducted business with this company and I called them to verify with my social if they have me in there system? and they had no record of any account with my social. I contacted the chex systems phone number and gave the representative my information and he was able to pull up my file but found no record of any account reporting a charge off in my name. The bank is requesting a letter from chex systems stating that their are no negative charge offs showing on my report. Chex systems is telling me they will be mailing me my file but this is not going to help me as I am on a time limit in approval for this loan that I have been approved. My father and my brother carry the same name and I am afraid that my information might be getting mixed when financial institutions pull my file. This needs to be addressed with chexsystems.
362737,Debt collection,the debt collector called my fellow employees at my workplace and shared personal information about me.they told other other employees about a {$12000.00} debt that was supposedly owed from 2001.they were harassing me as well after i told them to stop calling me.

I had to talk to XXXX different representatives and XXXX had told me XXXX so I asked to speak with the manager who proceeded to call me uneducated because they lied and did not explain very well to me where my payments are gong to.

And all XXXX of them would talk over me and then yell at me if I tried talk. I had to call my bank and tell them to unauthorized the transactions since they would not do it.

300785,Credit card,"My husband and are Citigold customers - preferred customers based upon aggregated balances with Citibank ( in excess of $ XXXX XXXX. We 've been told numerous times by branch employees as well as Citigold account representatives that with being a privileged customer comes special benefits. One of those benefits is no foreign transaction fees. We were told this on numerous occasions and it applied to all of our Citi products. 

Recently my husband and I were traveling overseas and used our Citi credit card and learned that a transaction fee was charged. Immediately upon our return to the states we contacted Citi bank to alert them to the information we received and we were told that 's not accurate for all products. This seems unfair and deceptive. I kindly asked Citi to make a one time concession for us and they have refused. 

Given the misinformation we received on numerous occasions, I believe Citi is not being clear and transparent with their customers. If this benefit only applied to certain products, then we would have used those products - we have multiple cards with Citi where it does apply. 

I 'd like Citi to refund our foreign transaction fees and be clear with customers on what it means to be Citigold and what it does not mean. And I 'd like them to educate all of their departments on the differences. Instead of just passing the buck of blame to someone else internally."

She was extremely RUDE and kept telling my wife not to interupt her. She would NOT tell her anything except Bankj of America had just aquired the loan & they want thier money. When my wife tried to get any info as to what the loan was about, she said we could settle the debt right now but would not say anything more than it was an old loan that BOA had just aquired and no other info from whom the loan was aquired.

To summarize this whole situation. The person who called was XXXX and she was mean and very rude. She told my wife this debt has to be settled today but would not reveal from whom BOA aquired the loan.

467521,Mortgage,"Our mortgage servicing company OCWEN every 6 months sends us a notice that our Condominium Association Master Insurance Policy on our rental property has expired. It then requires us to contact the Homeowners association and master insurance company to provide all the master policy information, endorsements, etc., etc. What on earth is the mortgage servicing company getting paid for if not for basic services like establishing contact the Homeowners Association to verify their Master insurance coverage? We are hounded every 6 months with this repeated huge paperwork exercise. OCWEN is getting paid to do this or do I misunderstand their obligations and what they are being paid for? We understand perfectly our requirement to verify we have homeowners insurance on the condo itself. 
This is just one of the regular hassles that OCWEN puts us through because they do not follow up on the information we provide or require repeated re-sendings of information and paperwork because they lose track of our material. OCWEN is without a doubt the worst organization we have ever dealt with concerning mortgages and insurance. Constant difficulties."

I said, let me make sure I am hearing this correctly, the computer pulled my credit report not 24 hours ago, you confirmed this, yet you have to pull another credit report, he said yes.

My attorney submitted my full and complete application on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and to date Roundpoint has not yet issued a decision. They keep asking for more paperwork every month and then let it expire and then ask for it again. I am told by my attorney that RESPA Reg X requires the lender to make a decision within 30 days of the application REGARDLESS if it is not completely complete. My attorney has an in house underwriter that put the file together and they state the lender ( Roundpoint ) has enough information to make the decision. I am not eve sure what decision they need to make as they have ROYALLY messed up my mortgage and it is on them to fix it. # 1 ) I was modified and my servicer never reflected it in my statement # 2 ) This is not my fault and the fact that my account is now past due and really messed up is either the servicer 's fault or my investor 's fault. It DEFINITELY is not my fault. # 3 ) My servicer needs to STOP EVADING reviewing my file as my attorney is billing me for work each time Roundpoint stalls and does n't make a decision as required by RESPA Reg X. I am being financially harmed by this illegal action. In another week it will have been 5 months since I applied for assistance in fixing my servicer 's mistake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please make them stop running me in circles and make them FIX THEIR MESS!"

I had not received any return communication from the settlement offer I submitted and it had been about two weeks. I reached the after hours message line. I left a voicemail with my first and last name, why I was calling, and my return contact number. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, I missed a phone call from a representative with XXXX XXXX XXXX named XXXX. The voicemail that she left cut in and out so I was not able to retrieve the phone number or the extension number she provided for me to return her call. I returned the call by contacting the number on the that XXXX had called my cell phone on which was XXXX. I told the representative that came on the phone line who I was, and that I was returning a phone call that I missed from XXXX. She took my information, and then put me on a brief hold. When she returned back on the line she informed me that XXXX was not available but that she would try to help me. She claimed to have pulled my file up and reviewed the notes. She stated to me that the settlement offer and payment plan I had submitted was not acceptable and would not be accepted from XXXX XXXX XXXX. She stated that it was not acceptable because I was asking for a settlement offer that was only 50 % of the total amount of the debt and that XXXX XXXX XXXX does not accept settlement offers that low, as well that my offer of {$42.00} a month was not acceptable. She continued to say that she needed to go over some information with me to determine what the lowest payment plan they would accept was, and that I needed to complete a financial form but that she would go over it with on the phone. She asked me questions in regards to how much income I got each month, how much my rent was, how much I pay monthly lumped together for utilities, auto insurance payments, car payments, how much was left on my auto loan, and lumped together for what I am paying in other debt repayment plans I am currently in. I was not prepared for these questions and I disclosed that to her and when I was trying to take my time figuring out accurate numbers for her she got upset and rushed me. She then asked me about my fiance 's income, which I feel should not be considered or even taken into account because we are not married. She placed me on a hold again to process the information I had provided her and came back on the line. She told me when she came back on the line that the lowest amount based on the information I had provided her that the lowest payment amount that XXXX XXXX XXXX would accept on the file was $ XXXX/month. I tried to explain to her that there was no feasible way that I could afford $ XXXX/month and that I had attempted to set up a payment plan with Midland Management Credit the original debt holder via their online site to enter into a payment plan of 120 months which equaled out to {$33.00} a month but it must not have gone through when I submitted it online as the account had been transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX. She would not let me even get that full sentence out before she very rudely interrupted and started to talk over me clearly stating "" We are not Midland Credit , XXXX XXXX XXXX is a law firm, we do not have to offer you the same options they may have. '' I again tried to explain to her that I could not afford {$290.00} a month, that I am barely making it paycheck to paycheck as it is. She again proceeded to cut me off and talk over me saying "" You can afford the {$290.00} a month based on the information you provided me, no payment has been made on this account since XX/XX/XXXX ''. She stated that if I did not pay the {$290.00} they would garnish my wages and take over {$500.00} of my check each paycheck until the debt was paid. That were also be added legal fees for taking it to court."

314535,Mortgage,"Second complaint ( original XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo did not address the initial complaint filed on XXXX with the CFPB. 

The complaint is that Wells Fargo notified originally notified deed holder of the initial auction date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX to be held in the XXXX court house in XXXX XXXX. This notice was served to the deed holder and notarized by the XXXX. At this point, there was no notification from Wells Fargo of a change in auction date as required by law ( state and federal ). At that time, Wells Fargo was ( according to law ) to change the deed into their name regardless of the auction taking place or anyone bidding ( that is the law ). 
They did not. 

Next notification from Wells Fargo was in XXXX of XXXX stating a new auction date was set ( this violates the deed holder notification guideline which states deed holder has to be notified PRIOR to the set auction, which was in XXXX XXXX ). At that XXXX XXXX auction, legally the deed should have been out of XXXX XXXX 's ( deed holder ) name in XXXX XXXX since no notification was given to XXXX XXXX ( deed holder ) of the auction date being change, per LAW. 
This is what our complaint is. Because of this, we were unable to qualify for FHA home lending, or conventional lending ; the date of the foreclosure is marked by when the deed is taken out of the foreclosed on 's ( deed holder ) name. That should have been XXXX XXXX. Instead, because of Wells Fargo not following the guidelines or law of the State of Idaho or federal guidelines that date of foreclosure was n't recorded until the following year at a different auction. 

The information Wells Fargo provided on complaint XXXX did not address this complaint, and did not address that notice of auction in XXXX XXXX. In fact, Wells Fargo neglected to present that information and manipulated their report and the information they provided ( which we 've provided them ), omitting what they wanted in order to support THEIR case. Wells Fargo has neglected to acknowledge the actual complaint we filed in complaint XXXX with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The resolution we request is to have a correction of deed recorded with XXXX XXXX.

I 've had so many wonderful times living here and I expect to create many more memories in the future -- -I love living here and have had no intentions to leave. Unfortunately, my mortgage lender ( Everhome ) does n't seem to have the same intentions as I do. Due to a few of hardships and Everhome 's lack of cooperation, I am now facing foreclosure on my property. 
My problems began oddly enough with the hardship of my rental property tenant. His lost job forced him to default on his rent payment. I tried to work with him to help get him back on his feet ( hoping this would be a short-term issue ), but unfortunately he was unable to get back to a point where I could collect rent from him. This put a heavy burden on me, and when he left I was now facing roof and other home repairs ( more of a financial burden ). If that was n't enough, I also needed to help my sister financially through a difficult time. I struggled to keep the mortgage current, but I eventually fell behind in XX/XX/XXXX. 
Once I fell behind, I reached out to Everhome to see if we could do something to solve this problem. I applied for a modification, but I was constantly chasing my tail trying to get documents submitted to them. The process took so long, and then they went ahead and denied my application. They claimed that I made too much money!!!! I guess I needed to be worse off to qualify? My hardships were real, and I ca n't just fork over the arrears to reinstate the loan after they delayed the modification process for so long and kept tacking on all of their ridiculous fees. Plus, they would n't accept any payments from me during this process to keep the arrears in check. I do well as a sourcing manager, but that should be a positive when evaluating for a modification, not a negative, since I 'm showing a strong ability now to avoid this happening again. 

Everhome is always sending correspondence offering help with this situation, yet they are not actually making much of an effort to solve this issue. There has to be another answer other than foreclosure. Everhome puts so much effort and manpower into harassing me with collection calls, yet no effort to find a solution for someone anxious to do business with them and according to their own analysis someone who is more than capable of making a mortgage payment. I 'm not looking for any handouts, just some common sense to solve a problem. I am ready to move forward and make good on this mortgage, I just need a little cooperation from them. I would be grateful for any assistance towards that end. Thank you for your time."
759020,Credit card,"Recently, I became aware that my credit card was switched from paper statements to electronic statements. This occurred without my knowledge or consent. I have been receiving paper statements for the past 20 years. I recently signed up for the credit cards rewards program and it may have switched me to electronic statements when I registered, however I was not aware of the change. I was not notified about the change to electronic statements via email or any other communication. I charged {$4.00} on my credit card and was waiting for my paper statements and eventually forgot about the charge. The bank charged me {$44.00} in late payments and place a 30 day late payment on my account. The only way I was to find out about this late payment was through my credit protection account, which notified me. I was never notified about my account being past due. The bank used deceptive practices to change my statements to electronic and profited from the result, in addition to damaging my credit. Precedence has been established during my 20 years of receiving paper statements and changing me to electronic payments without notification is Illegal."

The motive of this complaint is because I have both of the credit cards blocked for about 2 to 3 weeks. I have a high frustration for the personnel that functions these credit cards. Every time I buy something in the store, I have to keep calling the Department of Fraud to keep verifying my identity. I can understand that it would happen a couple times by error, but it has happened 10 times. I am insanely mad with the waste of my time and credit because of the frustration of this situation. What else do they need? They keep calling and I have to keep verifying my identity every time. They send me messages with codes, I give them codes and this keeps going on. I ask them, how far will this go? I ca n't do anything or check anything because of the constant blockage. 10 days ago I had bought a large amount of items and when I went to pay the account was blocked once again, and once again I had to do the whole process over again. But this is the limit that I 'm going to take with my patience. This department of fraud says that I have to receive a letter and follow those steps to get my account to normal. They told me that I had an account for Macy 's and it was opened by fraud, which is true because I was a victim of identity theft but this problem was resolved with the Department of Fraud of Macy 's. And everything was resolved through that department and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I am tired of the lack of respect with so many verification that I have to do."

Our loan officer was a nice guy who tried his best to help us but our closing was awful. It was a 7.5 hr closing with our final CD only issued about 2-3 hours into closing instead of 3 business days before. We ended up wiring a substantial amount of money to an escrow account prior to closing based on the verbal instructions from our loan officer. We were not provided with the final CD as required by Fed law. The sellers attorney left after a few hours for another closing. Chase XXXX up the titling on our mortgage which affected our deed. Chase had our closing date wrong which would have meant a dry close on Monday instead of Friday. The title company officially closed at XXXX. The closer stayed until XXXX to try to get the loan done. Chase 's closer and loan department stopped picking up our calls or responding to emails and voicemails. Our IL closing was handled in XXXX. We ended up having to reschedule our move, we had to hire a dog walker since we couldnt leave the title company. We ended up having to take the entire day off work instead of the 2 hours allocated for the close. Chase didnt bother to send a representative to the closing. We ended up dialing everyone we could think of at Chase. I had a Chase branch manager try to get hold of someone to help us figure out how to get the correct info submitted. We had to sign the mortgage docs without very much time to review because of the time deadline and the pressure from the title company closing. The sellers were irate. We submitted a formal complaint the Monday after closing and didnt hear back from the Customer resolutions team until today. She hadnt bothered to review the file. I submitted phone records, copies of emails and a narrative statement to our branch manager who forwarded it to the loan officer and his superior. I would be happy to share those with your department. I could not paste that here due to the character limit."

213646,Credit card,"Re : Synchrony Bank ( JC Penney account ). 
I never chose to do business with Sychrony Bank ( formerly called GE Credit ) but they handle JCP credit card accounts as well as credit cards for Lowe 's, Walmart and several other retailers. This complaint involves XXXX furniture purchases at the JCP store in XXXX, ID on XXXX/XXXX/15 and XXXX/XXXX/15. I first purchased a sofa and chair at JCP on XXXX/XXXX/15 which totaled {$1300.00} and canceled the order on XXXX/XXXX/15 for the same sofa and chair in a different fabric and color for a total price of {$1300.00}. I was offered "" Special Financing '' on a 36-mo Interest-Free Plan w/a down pymt charged to my regular JCP account. The down pymt on XXXX was {$270.00} which has never been refunded to me after this order was canceled on XXXX and has remained on my acct balance for 4 mos@26.99 % interest. The XXXX purchase on XXXX was for {$1300.00} w/a down pymt of {$190.00} also applied to a regular JCP account. Both the purchase price on XXXX in the amt of {$1300.00} and the down pymt of {$190.00} were lumped into my regular JCP account rather than the Interest Free Special Financing over 36 mos so I 've had to pay 26.99 % for 4 mos now. No one at the JCP store in XXXX understands the stmts issued to JCP customers by Synchrony so they are no help. The monthly stmts are full of careless/sloppy mistakes so it appears whomever prepares these stmts uses XXXX only as a XXXX language and has no experience or understanding of billing for retail stores -- or else everyone at Synchrony is as corrupt as the institution of Synchrony Bk. The Home Store Supr at JCP in XXXX tried to intervene and told me who to call at Synchrony ( a Supr ) who would not take my call and has not returned my call. I have written to the JCP store in XXXX and to Cust Svc at XXXX to no avail. I feel like XXXX and would appreciate someone at CFPB intervening on my behalf. I 'm XXXX yrs old, a retired XXXX XXXX so I understand finance very well so I 'm outraged about what 's happened here and do not understand why no one at JCP seems to care how customers are being cheated at Synchrony. I have sent copies of my letters to the CEO at JCP. Synchrony Bank is a corrupt institution and does not regard JCP or other retailers ' customers as "" customers ''. To them we 're just debtors and they treat us like deadbeats which I am not. The fact that Synchrony gets away with their corrupt practices is a result of deregulation of the financial services industries per "" The Financial Services Modernization Act ''. I am asking for a refund of {$270.00} for the down pymt of purchase on XXXX that was canceled on XXXX and a refund of interest charged on that down pymt + the interest I 've been charged since XXXX on the "" interest free '' 36-mo pymt plan and that stmts be corrected to reflect the interest free pymt of $ XXXX/mo for the XXXX purchase. As it stands now mo stmts do not reflect this pymt or the balance on the interest free plan -- both are simply lumped into the regular acct@26.99 % interest. Synchrony Bank should be in your data bank as you have received other complaints from this company which are filed online on XXXX."
46273,Credit reporting,"I have been in written communication for the past six months or more with transunion. transunion has been reporting several inaccuracies on my credit report. the inaccurate information on my report is preventing me from getting an apartment and credit. when i reached out to transunion they sent me a letter stating that the information was verified. I then sent another letter with information that supports the inaccuracies that was sent by certified letter twice and still no response.

The accounts in question is XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX is XXXX accounts in question.. The issue I have withe the reporting and validating the account is that they did n't validate the account.

Now as for the second account. transunion is not reporting this correctly as well and i want trans union to immediately stop reporting on this account. Transunion claims that this account is valid however they have yet to send me proff of it 's validilty when i reached out to fingerhut they advised that they sold the account. so first off if this account is sold trans union should not be reporting this as a fingerhut account/ I was told that midland credit services has this account and that fingerhut is no longer responsible. XXXX services when i reached out to them advised, that they received the account they reported on the account however after receiving my formal written dispute about this fingerhut account. XXXX decided to immediately cease reporting this account. So why is transunion still reporting a sold account that no longer belongs to the original owner. They are awre that a company can not buy back and an account once it has been sold so why is this account being reported as such. Transunion has failed to "" validate '' this account with these error and therefore I am executing my right for the third and fourth time to has transunion stop reporting these accounts immediately"

Seriously, I am being penalized because I actually pay off my balance more than once per month? Each time I have called, they have released my payment and then had the nerve to spin the conversation as if somehow they 're doing me a favor.

660289,Student loan,"I am currently paying mostly interest on an XXXX loan. I am being crushed. I am also told by Navient that I am not eligible for any kind of feasible repayment plan. I am unable to even make a dent with the affordable payment that I am currently enrolled for, as all I am paying is interest. No one on the phone seems to be able to help, or listen. They just keep repeating the same canned information and offering me a payment that is way too high for what I can afford. It also seems convenient that my largest loan amounts have the highest interest rate. 

Because of my husband 's income, I am not eligible for any forgiveness, but he spends his paycheck making up for the deficit that is caused by these enormous payments, that do n't make any difference, other than filling Navient 's pockets. And I work mainly in non-profit and XXXX in Michigan, where I struggle to find full-time work, as there are significant economic problems within the state itself, so most of my meager nonprofit or XXXX paycheck goes toward paying the interest on these loans. 

I was severely unemployed for several years, due to the country 's economic downturn, and relocation, and I am currently paying interest for the country 's mistakes. Meanwhile my debt goes nowhere. I am sure that pleases Navient, and understand that I am most likely wasting my time contacting them, or fighting this issue, but wanted to make an effort before moving beyond to either filing for bankruptcy, or other measures to resolve this issue. 

I understand that I took out these loans, and I understand that I need to pay them back, which is why I signed the agreement. I did not agree to be unemployed, and underemployed for several years. That was not my choice. And because I was not technically on unemployment, because I chose to not be a drain on the government resources, and work part-time, minimum wage jobs to survive, I am being punished. I could not have anything waived, because I was working part-time, but the interest kept accruing. I have been gainfully employed for a few years now, luckily, but I am being literally crushed by the interest on these loans. I lie awake at night worrying about this, forcing myself to resign to the fact that I will be paying Navient 's interest for the rest of my life ( and I am XXXX now ). I know many people that have already thrown up their hands and just stopped paying, but I choose to be responsible, and know that I signed on to borrow the money, which is why I am still paying."

This process took over a year and, in the long run, they cancelled our modification without our permission because we fell outside of their timeline due to the fact that we were waiting for them to respond to something we requested in writing. I have made several complaints about this mortgage company and so far nothing has been done in our favor. The only reason we even have a mortgage with this company is because our mortgage keeps getting moved by the government due to fraudulent lending practices. Each time we are moved to an increasingly fraudulent lender and our account suffers as a result of this. It has been an ongoing battle with mortgage companies since at least 2007."

On XXXX, XXXX, the local Chase Branch informed me that they have not been able to find my {$2100.00} and requested me to contact the sender to reissue me a new check without finding the ATM issue. This is unacceptable and irresponsible attitude towards this investigation and I can not accept their findings so far. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I went to the Chase bank to request them to access ATM to find my {$2100.00} check which was not successfully deposited due to ATM technical problem. The Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, refused to access ATM for my check because I filed a claim over the phone and I also received the temporary credits provided by Chase on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I insisted on asking XXXX to check the ATM three times when I was there on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, but she refused to do anything. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, per my discussion with XXXX XXXX of Chase Executive Office over the phone, I have not obtained anything new from her and XXXX told me it would take 45 days till XXXX/XXXX/XXXX deadline for Chase to conduct their research and investigation without any detailed reasoning. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX at the local Chase branch office over the phone and he told me that he spoke to the Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and told me that they could not find my {$2100.00} check. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I went to Chase Branch and spoke to XXXX and showed him the ATM receipt that I obtained on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX asked for another Chase bank rep to open the ATM and checked. As a result, they were still not able to locate the {$2100.00} check and asked me to contact the check sender to reissue me a new check as their resolution. 
Chase would have more chances to find my {$2100.00} check when I was in the branch on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, why did Chase Branch Manager refuse to access ATM at that time? Why did the Chase wait for two weeks to access the ATM on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to try to look for check again? Why is the procedure to access ATM totally changed within two weeks on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX? How could the {$2100.00} check disappeared without trace? Please request Chase Bank to show solid evidence with all of taped videos and ATM logs to investigate whether they have done proper procedures to protect customer 's assets and rights. 

Furthermore, in XXXX XXXX XXXX, I had awful experience with the same local Chase Branch which is the closest Chase branch to where I live. The teller thought I occupied her time to deposit checks in the counter and asked me to do deposits at ATM. The teller seems she did not want to serve me. Due to this bad experience, I feel reluctant to go to the counter. That was why I deposited the check at ATM from time to time. Then the ATM got technical problem and swallowed my check on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Back in XXXX XXXX, I have filed a formal complaint to Chase Customer Service and I obtained a response from XXXX XXXX of Chase Executive Office dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX attached, which did not address my concerns/issues other than perform a formality."

I discussed the issue with his manager, and he said there is nothing they can do. I asked him to review the recorded conversation.

He called his bank to see if they can see if anything went wrong, but they said there was not any transfer that went to the account. So, I submitted XXXX claims to Wells Fargo, and they said everything went correctly on their end and that they could not do anything much more. They offered to send any documents that they used relating to the claim showing how they determined the outcome, but they had no documents to show for. I am submitting to claim to determine where my money went."
114443,Mortgage,"I had an escrow account for my XXXX parcels of property. In XX/XX/XXXX I forwarded my county & school tax bills to Franklin American Mortgage Company for both parcels as instructed. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a late tax bill from the county indicating that all taxes for XXXX of my parcels were unpaid. I called FAMC on XX/XX/XXXX & was told to mail the bill to FAMC and they would pay it & cover any late fees. I forwarded it as directed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a delinquent tax notice & called XXXX & spoke to XXXX. I was given an e-mail address to send the bill to & told that it would be paid right away. I e-mailed the notice that day & called back on XX/XX/XXXX to follow up. I spoke with XXXX, who said they were in the process of confirming the tax assessment. On XX/XX/XXXX I called again & was told that the bill would definitely be paid by XX/XX/XXXX, the date on which the notice indicated additional fees would be added. I was assured that any fees were not my responsibility. On XX/XX/XXXX I called again & spoke with XXXX. He assured me that the bill would be paid by the next day & said he was escalating the issue. He advised me to call back on XX/XX/XXXX if I wanted to have confirmation that it was paid. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, who told me that the tax bill had been paid in full all along & that she would mail me documentation indicating such. I made sure she was aware that there are XXXX parcels of property. That day I called my tax office to verify that the taxes had been paid. They told me that my second parcel had not been paid. On XX/XX/XXXX I called FAMC & asked for a supervisor. I spoke with XXXX, who said he would take care of it & call me back the following day. To date, I have not received a call back from him. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a QWR to FAMC explaining everything detailed above & asking that my overdue taxes be paid immediately. I also requested that once my XX/XX/XXXX overdue tax issue was resolved, I wished to waive my escrow account, because I did not wish to encounter issues with my XX/XX/XXXX taxes. I was clear that I was not absolving FAMC of their obligation to pay my XX/XX/XXXX taxes. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice from the county via certified mail that I still had delinquent taxes & that my property would be sold if they remained unpaid. I called FAMC once again & spoke with XXXX. She confirmed that my QWR had been received on XX/XX/XXXX. She did not explain why I was not notified in writing of receipt of it within 5 days, as is required by law. She asked me to e-mail this notice. I asked to speak with a supervisor & spoke with XXXX. She assured me that it would be resolved by XX/XX/XXXX & FAMC would cover any fees. I asked why this had taken so long to resolve & why I had been promised a call back previously, but had not gotten one. XXXX said that if for some reason, it was not resolved by XX/XX/XXXX, she would call me back by XX/XX/XXXX. To date, I have not received a call back from her. On XX/XX/XXXX, I e-mailed the notice as directed. I received a reply saying I would get a response within 24 hours. I did not receive a response until XX/XX/XXXX. In that e-mail, I was told that my escrow account had been waived on XX/XX/XXXX &, therefore, my taxes could not be paid & were my responsibility. I replied that that was unacceptable & contrary to what I had been repeatedly told. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called back & asked for XXXX or XXXX. I was given a different supervisor, XXXX. I explained everything to her, including my frustration. She assured me that FAMC would make restitution, because I had an escrow account when the taxes were due. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called & said that FAMC will send me a check with which I can pay the taxes. Because of this assurance & knowledge that fees would increase further as of XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the overdue taxes out of pocket, for 3 times the initial amount. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voicemail from XXXX saying that FAMC actually wo n't be covering the tax bill, because I no longer have an escrow."

She died around XXXX with an official time of death being XXXX on XXXX 2016 ( due to the time it took the coroner to arrive at her home ). While my father grieved for his loss, the oldest daughter withdrew all the money in this account and transferred it to her personal account. We notified the bank of her death on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and proceeded to close out the other bank accounts. However, the bank missed this account and kept it open. The final amount of money was transferred to the oldest daughter 's account on XXXX - 1 day after the bank was notified of her death. The {$4000.00} in the account disappeared and there was nothing left for my father upon his wife 's death. The bank was Bank of America and I believe they made a mistake by not putting a hold on all accounts in my step-mother 's name, which allowed her daughter 's to remove the money ( legally belonging to my father ) on the day of her death and the following days after the bank was notified of her death. Now Bank of America will not answer any of our questions related to this account because my father was not a signer on the account. My father has XXXX and can not speak for himself any longer.

The balance on the day of her death was {$3900.00} and my father got none of this money. Is Bank of America responsible for restitution since they did n't put a hold on the account upon hearing of her death? Can we get our money from B of A or do we have to sue the step-daughters? The estate department at B of A will not respond to any questions - because my father was not on the account, but also because they know they messed up by not putting a hold on the account when they learned of the death on XXXX XXXX."

I waited until after XXXX/XXXX/16 XXXX p.m. to write a check to myself for deposit in my bank account at XXXX in the amount of {$500.00}. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received an email from Bank of America telling me that my account was overdrawn. I called customer service and was told that the hold was extended on my account but was not told when the money would become available or given a specific reason as to why the hold was extended. I advised Bank of America that I had written a check to myself for {$500.00} and I was told that they were determining whether or not to honor the check. I told them that the deposit check was from a law firm that I worked for, but they did not respond. On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, 2016, I obtained a copy of the cancelled deposit check for {$5000.00}, which indicated that the funds had been paid over to Bank of America on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I took the copy of the cancelled check, the receipt from Bank of America indicating that the funds would be available on XXXX/XXXX/16 after XXXX to the branch where the check was deposited. The bank refused to credit my account with the {$5000.00} and said that the hold would not be lifted until the end of business on XXXX XXXX, 2016, but would not give any explanation as to why and did not address how they could hold my funds when I showed them proof that the check had been paid. Bank of America agreed to remove the returned check charge for my {$500.00} returned check and a {$12.00} service fee today, but would not make the funds available immediately. This is clearly wrong and outrageous behavior on behalf of this bank. I also incurred additional bank charges on my XXXX account because the {$500.00} check was returned as unpaid by Bank of America. Bank of America has advised that they can not reimburse me for fees charged by XXXX."

Currently Citibank has produced no evidence any money was owed. If you are unable to produce that evidence then I 'd like the overpayments returned.

I responded stating the a/c was closed, asking them to correct their records. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a Citi ( XXXX ) threat letter aimed at collecting debt!

This letter asked me to call, and did not advise that I would be waiving some of my consumer rights by doing so. I responded in writing pointing out the account was closed. A few days later, a threat letter specifying over {$600.00} was unpaid and overdue, was received under the same Citi ( XXXX ) name. I am sending a response in writing again. 
This is harassment at this point. Citi has ignored my instructions to close this account, which had no balances or overdrafts. Citi has not responded to my written requests to close this account and provide status. I had accounts here for 25 years. How deceitful and dishonest Citi has become, with low customer service standards. There is not one shred of decent customer service on display here.This company is clearly out of control.

I have been very timely returning their requested info, but SPS keeps asking for new Docs. each of these new requests for documentation is to support other previously submitted documents which support the information I provided on my application. The different requests I believe are not informational, but rather a delaying tactic. More frustrating is the fact that I have been told half a dozen times that the underwriters have what they need to make a decision, only to have them request another more obscure document. Dealing with customer service reps has been troubling since it is a different representative every time, so I 've had to answer the same questions over again and again, months apart, and the information they often ask for was included on the initial application.

The dispute was supposed to take 10 business days but they responded to me the same day saying, "" Unfortunately there is nothing we can do.

85303,Credit card,"In paying my regular monthly payment for my Best Buy card for the month of XXXX, I attempted to pay the regularly scheduled payment due. I was shocked when I received a call from my bank telling me an item for over {$2000.00} from Best Buy was attempting to clear my account. Somehow, in trying to make my payment of {$66.00}, a payment for the full balance was made. I believe this is because Best Buy has the full balance as the default amount, & when paying through the mobile site, things constantly bounce back and forth & change before you are able to realize anything has happened. I immediately called Best Buy customer service, & I was told that once they received the payment back from the bank, I could make the correct payment, plus submit the information showing the fee I was charged by the bank ( that they would not refund ) so that Best Buy could refund that fee. This was on XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I received another call from my bank ( XXXX VA ) letting me know that this same item has again been presented for payment. I again requested that the item be returned. I was charged another fee by the bank. Unfortunately, the bank also paid this item against my account instead of returning it, causing my account to be negative. I was unaware that the item had been paid until XXXX/XXXX/16 when I checked my account online. XXXX, the bank associate I dealt with, suggested that my only course of action was to come in to the bank & file a dispute. From working at XXXX previously, as well as several other financial institutions, I know first hand that customers should ALWAYS contact the merchant or company in a dispute situation before asking the bank to step in. I advised XXXX that I was aware of this, & would contact Best Buy first. Again, I immediately called Best Buy 's customer service line, & spoke with a different agent than I did the first time. This agent informed me that an item that has been returned will attempt to clear a total of 3 times, something I was not told in the beginning ; I was originally led to believe that once the item was returned on XXXX, that was the end of it. This individual let me know that once the item tried to clear the third time, I could call Best Buy back & begin the dispute process. I would need to write a letter describing the events that transpired, send a copy of my account transactions showing the fees that were charged due to this situation, & request that Best Buy refund them since the bank would not. When I noticed on XXXX that the item had been paid by the bank & not returned, I called the branch & spoke with XXXX. I asked why the item was paid not returned as we talked about ( I was never given a clear answer on this ) ; I also asked about the autodrafts that would be coming through my account on XXXX & XXXX as it was too late to stop them. After much discussion, XXXX told me that she would pay those items through & not charge an overdraft fee for them ( the items were {$25.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX, {$100.00} to XXXX, & {$250.00} to XXXX XXXX ). I was forced to call back on XXXX when I discovered that the {$25.00} item to XXXX XXXX XXXX had been returned & a fee charged. XXXX stated that there were not enough funds in the account, & denied that we had ever had a conversation concerning the items. Thankfully, my husband was home when I originally spoke with her, & the phone was on speaker. At this point, the dispute had already been filed with Best Buy, & I was simply waiting on the refund to my account. XXXX was extremely rude, & suggested I should have bypassed Best Buy & gone straight to the bank & I would have already had my money back. At this time, I have XXXX NSF/OD fees charged, & after multiple communications with Best Buy, they refuse to assist with ANY of the fees. I have requested that XXXX of the fees be refunded, and they refuse."

326630,Bank account or service,"For the past year, I have repeatedly informed this institution on the best feasible way to reach me and each correspondence is sent certified mail. I have stated on the web for the past 6 months that I CAN NOT access the loan portal page since Bank of America changed some permissions on the portal so I am unable to access and technical support was unable to override. 

Per the attached, there has been challenges with either receiving mail or having mail sent of the office. ( see attached ). If I am unable to obtain some items which are FREE this would indicate that are issues. I also requested that if I needed to be contacted to please contact me at my residence at XXXX. I am charged to connect to BOA from XXXX and if a fortune XXXX company can not contact regarding this issue or issue a collect number I 'm further concerned about this consistent attempt of BOA to insist they have n't received documentation and/or can not contact me. In addition, there is a XXXX hour time distant from the XXXX to XXXX so please do not contact me after XXXX. 

Additionally, on three separate occasion BOA or its agents have been on-site to either threaten or prevent rental of this property. This documentation has been sent on various occasions with dates and names. This has cost me thousands of dollars to include issuing a writ of possession since the agent informed the tenant that she should not be paying rent. Eviction resulted in XXXX worth of damage to the residence. BOA asked if I would be able to pay XXXX of good faith money down and I asked if they would like for me to put those funds down or to pay for the damage. There was never a response so I assumed the repair I have before and after photos to validate my good faith. 

This coupled with the fact that this company has not attempted to complete the RMA, sent back two certified full payments which would have taken the house out of foreclosure at the time and NEVER informed me to make a payment. Illustrates the intent of this institution to be unwilling to adhere to acceptable mortgage servicing practices. 




Therefore, I requested that the home be sold at XXXX which is the cost of the last appraisal conducted. This also is in accordance with the loan modification process ( attached ) but NOT adhered to by BOA. 

With all the documentation that I have on file and the correspondence submitted and not acted upon I am pretty confident, well documented solid case. I am unsure if this case of rampant through BOA or if this is a rare occurrence. However, I truly do not wish to have any dealing with BOA and would like to sell this residence so I can get on with my life."

I went to get preapproved for a home loan and the Loan Officer told me that it was under Bankruptcy so I would not be able to get a loan for 7 years.

I sent several email inquiries to Chase, and each one said the fee was justified, because my "" targeted offer '' did not include the annual fee waiver, despite what I had seen on my offer, as well as consistently in their advertising. One of the last emails I had received, when I escalated it, complaining of their fraudulent marketing, basically said that because I had applied online ( as one is apt to do these days ), the annual fee waiver was not honored in my case, and there is no way to change it at this point. They basically admitted they used deceptive marketing practices, refuse to honor their "" card benefit '' of "" first year annual fee waived '' and despite all my email attempts, will take no further action, basically saying I was penalized for applying online. They do not care that I have discussed filing complaints with the CFPB and my state 's attorney general, as they, as a big corporation, really do not care about consumers, and consumers ' rights."

I than asked why they would report this to a credit bureau and they stated that in NO way do they report to credit agencies nor verify the information by phone and in fact the only way to get the report I would have to pay a fee which I declined to do.

I have attached the statements which show the increase in the rate of interest. Their inability to furnish card member agreement or marketing materials, will prove that the bank is trying to suppress information and their guilt.

371555,Student loan,I am a XXXX person suffering from both XXXX. When I first became unable to work because of my XXXX I agreed XXXX applying for a economic deferment with my loan company Nelnet. I apologize but because of my XXXX status I am not sure whether or not this is a Perkins or a private loan company I believe that is possible that I had taken out both but my XXXX has deteriorated greatly since I was in school. I literally have XXXX + emails where I have been trying to resolve this matter I have submitted the forms that were requested of me over 50 times. I contacted my school rhode island college to try to get help but they refused saying it was all nelnet. I even have emails from Nelnet where they agree that they received the documentation and agreed to process it. They are playing games with me when I submit the economic deferment they write me back letter saying that they are denying me a XXXX forgiveness. There was one time at the very beginning of when I was pulling in these applications that I had applied for a XXXX forgiveness not realizing that I was not eligible by the guidelines. That was one time over two years ago since then I have only sent in the application for economic deferment but I still continue to get told that I am not eligible for the XXXX forgiveness. I tried to contact the Better Business Bureau to get this resolved about a year ago and now that refuse to answer any of their contact So eventually they told me there was nothing they could do because the company was not cooperating. A few months after that I contacted the Rhode Island XXXX office for help and was hooked up with a woman XXXX XXXX. Back in XXXX of 2016 XXXX was able to speak with somebody at Nelnet on my behalf they once again claimed that they had never gotten the application and I was told to resubmit it and everything would be resolved. I did just that sending in the economic deferment and supporting documentation for the 75th time but it did not make any difference. The few times I have been able to reach a associate by the phone I have been giving incorrect information at XXXX point I was told that my deferment had been granted about 3 weeks ago I was told that once again no one had to receive that documentation and that as long as I sent it in before XXXX there would be no issue with a bill. However only two days after speaking with this AssociateXXXX I got a letter in the mail saying that my account was 153 days past due and I was going to be reported to a credit agency. It has been commonplace for me to get XXXX response from a person on the phone and then a few days later get a bill or notice that totally contradicts what I was told. Most recently I was able to get ahold of XXXX XXXX again and she had called into Nelnet and was told that I had applied for a XXXX deferment and had neglected to send in the doctor paperwork which is not the case at all I even have emails where I write out an all-caps I applied for an economic deferment I am not applying for a XXXX forgiveness. I have at least XXXX emails that state this yet when she calls they give her a story to make it look like Im the one not doing what im suppose to. In my current state I can not make heads or tails over what is going on anymore and I am scared that my XXXX check will be attached to this student loan even though I have done everything that I am supposed to do in the amount of time that I was supposed to do it. I am not kidding when I tell you I have over XXXX emails going back and forth trying to resolve this matter. It doesnt seem like the senators office is really helping much at all in this matter and Im very much scared now for my credit any XXXX income i might get will be taken from me.

I filed dispute end result was that signatures match so they determined it was n't fraud. It is in fact fraud, I asked them to show me footage of security camera and that I had told them not to allow transactions because we were both at work, not out shopping."

He is no longer with the company when we called to get the status and we were told to reapply. Now we are {$12000.00} in the rears, this is a disgrace and predatory lending and fraud. Capital one is deceptive, racist and misleading. They have put people in a foreclosed state. They play games with their modification and cause people to go into foreclosure. We are going to the press and to the US JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE POOR MISLEADING, DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF CAPITAL ONE. WE ARE FILING SEVERAL FEDERAL AND STATE COMPLAINTS AGAINST CAPITAL ONE AND HOPE YOUR COMPANY WILL DO SOMETHING TO HELP US AS CONSUMERS. The last time, they claimed was because of a notary and now they have NO REASON because they no longer have that employee so they chose to let us fall between the cracks. We were told by a XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/15 at approximately XXXX XXXX to fax in XXXX of my XX/XX/XXXX stubbs to get the modification reopened. I am faxed the check stubs tonight per her request and plan to call a man she referred to as XXXX. When I called back that same night, I spoke to a representative who told me to talk to a XXXX who is our caseworker who is working on our case. These stories and characters change with each phone call to capital one. We made sure this was well documented to use in case we sue capital one. I sincerely hope you will make them review and approve this modification and stop playing games. Its a disgrace. President obama put guidelines in place to protect consumers against these predatory practices and deceptive business practices with these fraudulent banks. I am a former elected official and I am not going to tolerate these unethical, fraudulent and deceptive business practices of with Capital One. Enough is enough."

This hardship that wells fargo placed on me by now demanding I pay back this money in 60 months and not allowing me to refinance or go through a loan modification stating I can afford the new payment due to my GROSS earnings has placed me to consider foreclosure and has made my family in crisis My original payment I was paying was XXXX wells fargo is now requesting me to pay XXXX.

Calls have been made by my mortgage broker to Ray Klein in order to have this debt removed from my credit report.

When they want the debt paid, they harass without any problem, garnish wages, sue people without an attempt at even collecting on the debt, call them relentlessly and even call people at their place of employment. However, when it comes to showing that a debt has been paid in full and is satisfied, call them relentlessly and even call people at their place of employment. However, when it comes to showing that a debt has been paid in full and is satisfied, they drag their feet. The people my mortgage broker and my husband have spoken with know we are currently in the process of purchasing a house and at this point is feels like they are purposefully holding out on showing the debt as satisfied. They also failed to tell us that they had other debts they were holding besides the judgment until we were ready to pay the judgment in full, with the exception of a past medical bill from XXXX.

My signature is not on any of these authorizations except XXXX I did not give my permission. I had called and spoke with numerous representatives who just assume hang up on you or tell you repeatedly that they can not help you with the Inquires. It also tell me that no one was affected by the glitch which was on all new channels even with proof in hand and they flat out absolutely refuse to connect with supervisor or anyone in the American offices to handle this matter per your request after XXXX + calls I gave up None of the reps were remotely helpful or even knowledgeable some knew and some would more or less say it sucks to be you and too bad
218987,Mortgage,"This complaint is to inform CFPB of the unfair and cruel way that my mortgage company have been treating me since the year XXXX when I started to have problems paying my mortgage due to hardship. At the end of XXXX, my husband divorced me which change the household income from around {$85000.00} a year to around {$20000.00} a year making it very difficult for me to make ends meet considering that I was a single mother of XXXX children with no help what so ever. This is when I reached out to my mortgage company asking for help with my mortgage. I placed numerous calls to them and I even applied XXXX times for a mortgage modification in which I was declined both times. Since then I have continued to ask for their help only to have them decline me of any available services and/or any assistance that they could have provided me with. Instead of helping me, they wanted to foreclose on my home. Then I managed to bring my mortgage payments up to date, however, they refuse to send me monthly statements since XXXX of XXXX leaving me with not knowing how my payments are being applied to my account, what are the extra charges that they are applying to my account, what my mortgage balance is and what are my official monthly payments. This has caused extreme stress on me!"
22734,Credit reporting,The reason I am complaining against sage stream is because I have on several occasions requested for my file to be frozen and they have not frozen my file or responded to my request. I need my file frozen.
557113,Student loan,I have been trying to consolidate my loans for the past 6 months now. My loans are supposed to be with ECMC-they are stating that my loans are in a repurchase phase and that they do n't have them and that they are to be picked up by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and they have no record of me whatsoever. I have been denied numerous time for consolidation because ECMC is holding and reporting incorrectly on my loans. They are improperly servicing my loans which is causing me negative reporting on my credit report. I am trying to re-establish repayment of my loans and can not do so because this agency ECMC is incompetent. Please recall me loans from them or have them properly update my loan information so that I can move forward with my financial obligation to repay my loans. They are reporting that I am in Bankruptcy and I have sent over my discharge notice to them as well and they are still incorrectly reporting on my loans.
55192,Credit reporting,I initiated a credit dispute with the XXXX credit reporting agencies on late payment remarks that are inaccurate. Also I did contact the creditors and they ran in investigation and sent me letters stating that I was not late. I have sent this to the credit bureaus and they refuse to do their jobs. I 'm just trying to get this rectified so I can purchase a new home for my family. I have made countless attempts and Do n't know what to do.

I have called the mortgage company twice now ( PNC Mortgage ) and have been told twice that the check is "" in the mail '' but there is no way to track mailing - when the check was actually mailed ( "" should have been XXXX XXXX '' ) - or where it might be because they do not have a way to track delivery. This is ridiculous. Surely there are faster and more sophisticated ways to process refunds, but I suspect PNC Mortgage will not do this because they have the benefit of holding on to my money for as long as possible and are not held accountable. It is completely unacceptable to tell me they do n't know for certain if the check has been mailed or where it is right now."

68641,Mortgage,"I have a mortgage with M & T bank on my home that I have lived in since 2009. We received several marketing letters from M & T bank via XXXX regarding possibly refincing our loan to get a lower interest rate and payment. I called to inquire about this and was told by the loan officer I was working with that I should be able to refinance my loan and save at least XXXX per month depending on what our house appraised for. They took a payment from me of XXXX including XXXX for the appraisal and XXXX for an application fee. They hired an appraiser who came out and did an appraisal that their underwriter "" rejected ''. I was never notified that the appraisal was rejected. XXXX said that she called my cell phone XXXX. that is not true there were NO missed calls for VM from her or anyone else that week. She also said that I was mailed a letter, I never received it. I asked about getting any of my money back and was told I could not.

22720,Student loan,"My loan is being transferred from XXXX to Navient ; and they are unsure of where the loan is in its processing. Navient is the recipient and has no record of me. XXXX is the seller and has a general time frame of 2 to 4 weeks ; but is not able to deal with my loan any longer. This means I am not able to make my monthly payment. When I do n't make a monthly payment, the interest continues to accrue on the current balance, rather than the slightly lower balance it would be at, should I have been able to successfully pay my monthly bill. Thus either XXXX and/or Navient will earn an additional profit by temporarily losing track of my loan."

I called XXXX six or seven times trying to get this fixed and get it back to them and they promised me that they were going to take care of it which they never did meanwhile the new collection agency hounded me for 3 to 4 weeks calling me almost 5 to 6 times a day I again explained to them that the mistake of XXXX and they really did n't care to hear about it all they wanted me to do is pay off their collection fee and the longer it takes more money i will owe them.

A supervisor told me they were mistaken. When I asked them to remove the collection from my report and send me documentation on the debt, I was told that it was a process and would take a while to resolve. 
I spoke to the original Creditor XXXX ( Who I still have an account with ) to address, they told me they did not know why it was reported, they showed no open collection account for me."
687787,Credit card,"I disputed a charge on my Bank of America credit card and provided copious documentation to support my dispute. BOA denied my dispute without requiring any information from the merchant OR providing me a valid reason why the documentation I provided was not sufficient. XX/XX/2016 I ordered an engraved cremation urn. Merchant engraved incorrectly. In my order I requested the name to be in ALL CAPITALS. Merchant did not do this. I initially tried to resolve with the merchant who refused to call me back or respond to emails, which necessitated the dispute. In my dispute I provided BOA a copy of my order which detailed the engraving request and pictures of the item received which CLEARLY show that the name was not engraved in all capitals. I also provided an outline of all my attempts to contact the merchant. BOA initially removed the credit card charge, but then requested that I find a third party expert to inspect the urn ( in person ) and provide written documentation to support my dispute. I responded to BOA, in writing, that this was not reasonable ( I did not know a local merchant who specialized in urns or who would be willing to get involved in my credit card dispute ). I outlined all of the documentation I had previously provided. I also asked BOA to provide me with the merchant 's response to my dispute, in addition to any documentation the Merchant was requested to provide to support that they fulfilled my order as requested ( to date, the Merchant still has not provided me with the item I ordered, for which I was charged {$140.00} ). Without any response to my written response/request for information, BOA arbitrarily denied my dispute. In summary, my complaint is that BOA did not demonstrate due diligence in their "" investigation '' of my dispute. They totally disregarded the documentation I provided, they did not respond to MY request for information regarding their investigation of my dispute, they did not require the Merchant to provide documentation that my order was fulfilled as requested and overall did not protect my rights as their customer."

732894,Consumer Loan,"I 'm not really sure if this is relevant to CFPB as I ca n't seem to find any relevant information regarding my situation. So I 'm pasting a copy of my original complaint to the State of Nevada Division of Finanicial Institutions for FDCPA violations. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, Peak Acceptance, a Sub-Prime Auto Lender, in an attempt to collect payment on an auto loan I 've had with them since XXXX 2015, a representative violated the Federal Debt Collections Practice Act by placing a call to my cell phone at XXXX Pacific Standard time and attempted to collect payment at what is clearly outlined under the FDCPA as an inconvenient time to me. 
I had requested several times that a manager contact me regarding the violation of the FDCPA against me and they failed or neglected whichever it may be to contact me. 
I made several calls between XXXX XXXX, 2015 and spoke to many "" Customer Service Reps '' requesting and demanding that a manager call me to discuss this matter and I finally got a representative to say "" We are handling the customer service for Peak Acceptance ''. I asked the representative "" are you a collection agency? '' the representative responded "" yes we are ''. I asked the representative "" What is the REAL name of your company, and he replied back "" XXXX Logics ''. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015 at XXXX I received a voicemail from XXXX XXXX, from Peak Acceptance asking me to call her back at ( XXXX ) XXXX which I did promptly. She asked "" what is the problem ''? I told her "" your agency violated both State and Federal FDCPA laws calling me at XXXX., on XX/XX/XXXX.She responded "" I will have to pull the phone log for that day and listen to the call and talk to my accounting department ''. I 've not heard back from her since. 
I know of one person who says she works for Peak Acceptance, her name is XXXX XXXX and her number is ( XXXX ) XXXX and she is the representative for Peak Acceptance Support Desk. I ca n't seem to find a Corporate Number for Peak Acceptance and that bothers me because I have no one to complain to that a Collection Agency is calling me when my payment is a day late and violating State and Federal Laws. 
I 've had several auto loans, and I 've always gotten called from the actual finance company about my payment being late. 
I do n't like the fact that 1. I 've been dealing with a collection agency to handle my loan servicing needs. Which tells me that, they have all of my Consumer Credit Information which means they can pull and review my credit report and see I have other accounts "" small '' in collections and attempt to contact that creditor or other collection agency to obtain the account and collect on it. 
2. I was not advised that collections are handled by an outsourced company a collection agency for that matter until XXXX 2015 months after getting the loan when XXXX contacted me to defer a few payments. 
3. I do n't appreciate being read the "" Collection Miranda '' every time I called "" customer service ''. It 's insulting and degrading whether my payments are on time or not. 
If the CFPB has any rules or policies regarding this matter, I 'd sure like to hear from someone about this good or bad."

Other representatives have told me an account may be flagged for review for eligibility because of returns made on the credit card, of which my account has none. I have been reading online about this promotional period, and it appears AMEX is trying to reneg on a promotion they offered widely to the public by falsely scrutinizing XXXX of accounts.

In case of XXXX credit card, I had returned stuff in the store and was told that I 'll get a refund but the refund was not applied for few months. Instead they kept charging late fees every month and later subtracted the refund amount and continued charging additional late fees. This was totally unfair because instead of being refunded I has bothered by XXXX and collection agency and made to pay. I tried to resolve this issue by calling, emailing and faxing them but all in vain. I am also attaching a fax that I had sent to XXXX. 
In case of XXXX credit card, my account was locked and was told to make the payment without being told what the charge was for. As my account was locked I was n't able to check myself. I contacted them several times to find out what the payment was for but was n't given a clear answer. 
In both these cases I was treated unfairly. In first case I was made to pay when I was supposed to get a refund. In second case I was being told to pay without the clear information of what the payment was for. I had to go through so much XXXX to resolve these issues and now I see these damaging my credit report.

They are now reporting me to credit bureaus as being not one time late but 2 reporting XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as late. This has impacted my ability to refinance my mortgage and the rates offered. We have repeatedly requested that they address this situation but they refuse to remove the incorrect reporting to the credit bureaus sending form letters every time we ask them to review the situation.

There are no assets to the husband 's estate except the home - which the wife already owns.

The response provided did not itemize the amount in question of {$58000.00}, rather the response actually said that the amount I thought had to be paid back after the 40 years is actually a principal forgiveness. On all of my statements there is a non-interest bearing balance where I have to pay this back. I called Nationstar on XX/XX/XXXX and I was on hold a few times throughout the 30 minute conversation which finally resulted in the rep telling me I see the letter that says principal forgiveness, we are confused and need to investigate and we will get back to you within a day. This company is confusing customers with their language and themselves as well. If the rep understood the agreement as actual forgiveness why do my modification papers say it is deferred and has to be paid back if I sell or transfer property. This is a distress to homeowners and an unfair practice, again this property is nowhere near being worth {$190000.00} in the crime ridden englewood neighborhood."
429890,Mortgage,"On XXXX XXXX, I went on the website LendingTree.com to search for a refinance of our current mortgage. In the questions I was asked if we had filed a bankruptcy in the previous 7 years. I answered yes, and that it was more than 6 years prior. 

Within a few moments, I received a call from a XXXX XXXX of XXXX. Initially the conversation was quite productive. I disclosed that in the XXXX bankruptcy, we surrendered a property which had a mortgage through XXXX XXXX XXXX. I explained that XXXX XXXX XXXX has refused to take title back despite our efforts. 

In a subsequent email, XXXX . XXXX quoted an unnamed manager who said that there was "" zero chance '' we still had title to the property, and insinuated we were lying. XXXX XXXX then refused to proceed with the application process. 

This scenario is a common XXXX, and well known to bankruptcy lawyers. There is no legal way to compel a lender to take back title and/or force them to release the lien. Properties become like zombies- not really alive, but not dead either. Debtors ca n't get them out of their names. I provided evidence of this by pointing to a memorandum issued by a bankruptcy judge. I also provided a copy of XXXX guidelines showing that lenders are supposed to verify the information and, once verified, go by the bankruptcy date. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and Lending Tree Inc simply do not have the right to be arbitrary and capricious in pre-judging loan applications. They have a duty to their investors and XXXX to investigate applications, but they also have a moral and legal duty to make sure applicants such as us are treated fairly and ethically. A government insured mortgage was an option that XXXX . XXXX could have pursued. By failing to do so, he effectively denied us a right to due process. 

We did not want to file for bankruptcy in XXXX. However it was necessitated by my total XXXX. We have managed our financial affairs quite well, and now have credit scores above XXXX. There is no reason for XXXX and Lending Tree to refuse to take our application."

I sent Equifax in XXXX and XXXX XXXX my correct address both online and by mail with copies of indentifying documents requested to verify my identity and current address. I think it only fair that the CEO of Equifax be ordered to send me his SS # and credit report so that I can then send it to WHO-EVER I want and expose him to the same risk of identity theft that he exposed me to. XXXX and XXXX did not do this, what the XXXX is wrong with Equifax?! Maybe I should be talking to an attorney for compensation."

I contacted all parties involved in my Student loans and after months of communication and paperwork my loans were deferred and I entered the XXXX XXXX and served in XXXX. The XXXX XXXX has all paperwork that XXXX XXXX and Navient requested. While overseas I was being constantly harassed by Navient stating I needed to make payments. Before leaving I ( borrower ) made sure all was taken care of and covered because I knew I had very little to no communication abilities due to remote locations. Hence the reason I made prior arrangements. My cosigner attempted to resolve matters but one person would say they can not help without my permission and another would tell him appropriate paperwork needed to be done. So payment arrangement were set until borrower could make contact. Then had issues with Navient taking more out of bank account than agreed upon so account was closed after I believe 3 payments but for six months following Navient continued to access account then report payment returned. Reporting nonpayment. Navient notified again borrower who was oversees and deferment arrangements were in place according to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Since returning to United States I set up a payment plan, paid on time and now request another deferment returning to school and unable to continue paying XXXX a month requested different arrangements and told I ca n't only option was apply for a hardship.

I am an XXXX year old who has made all attempts to follow protocol ( adult thing ) by the book. I am in no way skipping out or refusing repayment. Just asking for help. No one at Navient talks except to feed you various stories then have another rep call and contradict previous conversation.

I have disputed the incorrect information several times and each time the credit bureau responds that it is verified. How can they verify something that is not correct? Apparently the law does not state how they are allowed to verify a bankruptcy and because the court does not verify they can use any 3rd party service they want to so called verify it. This is according to the credit bureau themselves, so not that they care its wrong as long as they verify it from some hack third party verification service that has it wrong. This misinformation has haunted my credit bureau for almost 7 years and I cant believe that a credit bureau has this much power and makes it so hard to get incorrect information off a report. The law needs to change and bureaus held accountable."

It was n't until I hired an attorney and got the attorney from NJ XXXX involved that Equifax accepted the documentation.

678355,Mortgage,"During the process of applying for a loan modification I ask if I could make my payments and was told NO that it would mess up the underwriters figures. It took XXXX 1/2 months to receive the first denial answer ( which made me 4 months behind on my payments ). On the second application it took four months to receive a denial answer which made us 9 months behind, Nationstar Mortgage says for us to be re-instated it will take {$13000.00} which includes late monthly payments and legal fees. 
We did get a loan modification from Nationstar Mortgage XX/XX/XXXX and two months into XXXX I XXXX at work and was unable to work. This is when all this started, I sent Nationstar Mortgage letters from my Doctors stating my condition both the XXXX XXXX doctor and the XXXX Doctor stated I was unable to work. I was told by my loan specialist that the Underwriters did not even look at the letters because it did not fit into or with their guidelines. I told Nationstar Mortgage during the last modification that I had paid off both of my car loans and would be able to set it up with my bank to have an automatic withdrawal of {$750.00} or {$800.00} to be taken out for a house payment -- -but this was not good enough for Nationstars ' Underwriters '. 
I was also told that Nationstar Mortgage did their own underwriting and financing and did not receive any money from the Government in XXXX when the Federal Government bailed out a lot of banks, well I just so happen to have gotten a letter from Nationstar Mortgage in which it states and I quote '' you were evaluated for mortgage payment assistance based on the eligibility requirements of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the owner/guarantor/trustee of your mortgage loan. '' I talked to XXXX from Nationstar this afternoon and ask him ask the banking situation and he said he really did n't know anything about it, and this is a man that works in the lost prevention section. 
Also during the two times we tried to get a modification I would get e-mails saying that we needed to send in this or that document, some of which we sent in no less that four times. After sending in the documentation they requested we would get a letter stating that it would take them from15 to 30 days to add those documents to our application and that they would get back in touch with us within 30 days -- -which goes back to what I was saying about making payments. 
It ended up looking like a catch 22 situation, one of which I wish we could get out of. I just want to start making my payments again and be able to stay in my house."

Since that time I have contacted Wells Fargo on numerous occasions asking about this loan and received the same "" answers '' over and over again. No information has ever been provided to me about this loan, or where this loan came from. I get a monthly statement that I have continued to pay out of fear of collections or negative impacts to my credit score. I have also contact Wells Fargo numerous times requesting my monthly payment to be lowered due to my income, housing bills and being a single mother. They have told me over and over again that because this is a private student loan they have nothing to offer to me that could help me lower my payment nor do they have any obligation to offer me anything because it is a private loan. I never once received any loan disclosure statements, never once did I sign ANYTHING for Wells Fargo for a private student loan, nothing at all that would make me feel like they obtained this "" loan '' on the up and up, so to speak. My biggest concern here is if this account is even legitimate or if I somehow have been affected by this huge scam of fake accounts that has been brought to the attention of the public. If I have been affected how would I know? Who would I contact? Where would I go? If I have n't been affected or "" scammed '' what are my options for help with private student loans?

90728,Mortgage,"First, the servicer, RCS, filed a foreclosure action when they had no cause. They claimed I had not made all payments on time, but at trial, I was able to show this was not true. Second, they then claimed that I had not provided all loan modification documents in a timely way. This was a last minute claim, and the plaintiff produced documents at trial that they had not provided during discovery. Their own records, which they hid from me until rebuttal, show that I had not only provided all documents, but that they had used fabricated, outrageous and irrelevant reasons to turn down each of my loan modification requests. They knew this, and mislead the court into believing I had not met the terms of the loan mod. They lied in court. Third, during the actual loan modification process, they ignored modification requests they received as late as XX/XX/XXXX. Finally, their own records show that ( a ) I was current when I asked for a loan modification, ( b ) they dragged their feet on the loan modification for two years, until the arrearages totaled approximatly the Net Present Value of foreclosing on the property. I contend that they never had an intention of entertaining a loan modification. They offered the loan modification only to put me in a position where ( they thought ) I would have no choice but to vacate the property and let them sell it out from under me. Now, when they filed with the court for a sale date, I answered with a motion to review the case showing the plaintiff had lied in court ( please see attached documents ). The Plaintiff 's reply was to sell the loan to another servicer and walk away."

94962,Debt collection,"Hello, My wife and I called XXXX XXXX to get an estimate on how much money it would cost us to file our taxes. They said we would have to come into the office and bring our documents for them to see to give us the estimate. When we arrived at their office XXXX XXXX said that our initial consultation was free and they would start charging once the work started. At that time we asked XXXX what the next step was, and we were informed that we needed to pay {$75.00} for a power of attorney so they could access our paperwork. XXXX took longer than what seemed necessary to get the form entered on the screen and we questioned her if she needed help entering the info on the screen. We assisted her with the information repeatedly to get it all entered, and finally got everything entered. Unfortunately we felt that after this process that possibly XXXX may have some difficulty doing her job, and did n't feel confident in using the firm. We called her secretary following this appointment to discuss whether XXXX is having cognitive or senility difficulties. The secretary asked us if we were going to continue to use their firm, and I said no. We expected to get the bill for the {$75.00} for the power of Attorney, but when the bill came in the mail it was for {$890.00}. 
I feel this is a gross misuse of billing. I was told the estimate for the work was free. Than XXXX took a long time talking about her other clients and what she does for them, giving examples of what she has done for them. It looks like they are charging us for listening to her long drawn out sales pitch. I am only willing to pay the {$75.00} that we agreed to pay for the Power of Attorney for to be submitted online. This we already consider a loss based on the fact that we did not feel comfortable to have them actually do our work. I contacted them to complain about the bill, and they said they are charging me for the time. I said "" What time '' I was told free estimate and {$75.00} for the power of attorney. I also said "" You did n't do anything for us to justify charging us {$890.00}. Are you you trying to take advantage of us? "". They refused to hear our opinion, and now we have a second bill from them through a Bill collector called IC System. This is completely unfair."

Today ( Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 3 business days later ), I checked the account only to find that my XXXX deposits are now expected to clear on XXXX XXXX, a full 9 business days from the date I deposited them. As a small business, this is a ridiculously long time to wait for a relatively small amount of money to clear, so I called Citizens Bank customer service to see if they could do something to speed it up. The answer I got was that they were unable to contact the XXXX banks who issued the checks I deposited ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX Bank ) in order to clear the checks, and that the only way they could speed up the process was if I called these banks personally, obtained the direct phone numbers of the people who are responsible for clearing checks, and then called Citizens back to give them these phone numbers so they can call too and clear the checks. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to do this, and since I am a new customer for Citizens Bank and this is my first deposit, I can probably assume that this will be my experience with them in the future as well. At this point, thanks to Citizens Bank I can not use my funds for the next two weeks, which is causing significant difficulty in my business operations. 

I do n't know whether it is legal for them to hold my funds for such long periods of time ( 9 business days or more ), but this is not a practical solution for my business, so I will be closing my business account with Citizens as soon as I can, and finding another institution."

When I called in and asked about the debit, the member services rep said she reached out to their cash applications team and she specifically said they made a mistake in crediting my account for the funds because they do n't show that they ever removed the funds from my account surfing the first transaction. I asked her how is it my fault that the bank made a mistake and now I have to pay for it. I was essentially told that even though they made a mistake, I still have to pay for their mistake and that they are n't going to own up to it. This is unfair and unjust treatment from a banking institution that is just expecting a consumer to pay them money based on the fact that they made a mistake. Even when the customer calls and goes up in person to ask about the validity of the credit and is told that it is valid."

612055,Credit reporting,"On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I attempted to resolve an issue with Certegy and their agent or subsidiary Complete Payment Recovery after a billing error at a merchant ( XXXX XXXX resulted in a returned ACH debit. Certegy steadfastly refused to document the dispute or continue the conversation unless I provided my driver 's license number, which the merchant does not have and which was not used in any way in my account relationship with the merchant. There was no question of my having established my identity to Certegy 's call center, since I had verified my name and had received their subsidiary 's notice at the address they had for me. The only reason for them to obtain my driver 's license number would be to attempt to decline checks and humiliate me in a retail store that used their service ; their flimsy "" for verification '' excuse for demanding the information reeks of the same "" for verification '' excuse used by fraudulent telemarketers phishing for social security and credit card account numbers. 
I offered during our conversation to pay Certegy the full amount of the returned ACH debit, as they had already advanced that amount to the merchant. They refused unless I paid their fee as well, and would not discuss the fact that the fee was caused by their client and not by me - unless I gave them my driver 's license number. 
XXXX would think that in an environment where consumers and organizations alike are vigilant about identity theft, a company like Certegy would make an attempt to resolve disputes without collecting information unrelated to the disputes themselves. In this case, however, it is clear that collecting the money is only a secondary concern for Certegy. Their primary concern seems to be creating a complete biography of this consumer so that that information can used for their profit. 
I have chosen to file this complaint under "" credit reporting '' because it is my belief that Certegy is a consumer reporting agency as defined in FCRA. For as long as they claim they do not have to resolve our dispute, I risk having Certegy report inaccurate information to other consumer reporting agencies, which will damage my ability to obtain credit or change employers. Their behavior in this case, if they report the inaccurate information or attempt to humiliate me by declining a check in a retail store, may very well be actionable apart from the instant dispute. 
I have attached the mailed notice from CPR and a copy of my complaint to XXXX which includes some more details."
568094,Consumer Loan,Beware they do not back the ones that get you the loan. I was told to expect a letter 1 mo prior when loan interest would be charge. I never got that letter just a XXXX charge on bill. Was told we do not send letter but it was on statement prior to this XXXX. Well I did not look for it because I was expecting that letter. They said to bad we do not care how they get us the loan we had date on bill. They would not even consider it was wrong to be told XXXX thing. Not our problem. Not good ethics at all to not care that who gives you the loan might be deceiving people. They would not even let me talk to upper management they just said they do not deal with customers. Bad bad business ethics. Do not get a loan from these loan sharks. Beware beware
83233,Mortgage,The reason for me filing this complaint is due to Nationstar Mortgage foreclosing on my property while I am undergoing a loan modification. Also the information they are requesting is unnecessary and was never requested when I was undergoing a loan modification with XXXX XXXX XXXX not until my account was sold and/or transfer to Nationstar Mortgage in the process of modifying my loan. I should n't have to write any letter of my living arrangement to qualify for a loan modification or supply any mortgage statement on property I am not seeking to modified. This information they are requesting is for personal use only and nothing else.
317422,Credit card,"For five years I have never been late on a payment with the merchant. The company, despite receiving returned emails and messages that my phone numbers were no longer in service reported me to the credit agency for my delinquency. The FIRST time the company contacted me by physical mail on XXXX/XXXX/16 I immediately contacted the company and offered to pay the full amount of my bill off but inquired with XXXX XXXX in the CMA department why they did not send the physical mail to me before reporting me as delinquent despite knowing that my emails and phone numbers were both coming back as not being in service. For a simple cost of a stamp my credit would have been saved and I would have paid instantly. My credit took a XXXX point hit for an trivial balance that I would have paid if I had any knowledge of any outstanding balance. The company charged usurious interest rates + late fees of over 350 % APR on this balance."
243582,Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2016 I sent inquiry to Chase regarding corporate fees and cost accessed to my loan. On XX/XX/2016 I received a response that I was n't responsible for corporate fees accessed XX/XX/2016 and XX/XX/2016 that they are non recoverable. I am concerned as to why fees and cost are being accessed on my loans when it is current. These fees were from XX/XX/2006. I had a loan mod and successfully completed the mod remaining current since that date. Why was n't these fees removed or rolled into the loan at that time? Why are fees and cost still on the loan XX/XX/2016? And if they were not recoverable why are they on my payment history in XX/XX/2016 10 years later? They are in violation of RESPA ACT. I also request recorded documents and letter dated XX/XX/2016 indicate they were unable to locate assignment of mortgage to Washington Mutual and WAMU to Chase. If those documents are not available how was Chase able to began foreclosure proceedings on my loan prior to XX/XX/2006 without proper documentation. Chase was violating many acts. I am demanding all recording documents including my executed modification. Being advised to go to the court house to obtain these documents are unacceptable ask have been paying this bank thousands of dollars. If my recorded docs are not available then where is these docs stored and can they retrieve these docs from that location. 
I would appreciate a response within 30 days.

102838,Debt collection,"In the spring of 2016 I reached out to credit agencies including Collection Service of Nevada as I decided to work on paying off my bills. I updated my information with them of both my home address and my work address. I told them that they were free to contact me at my home address. 

They served me a lawsuit for small claims court at my work address. I paid the default judgement off within a week of the default judgement being awarded. I asked them not to contact me anymore since I had no more business with them ( because the debt had been paid off ). 

They just mailed me a document they submitted to the court that I had paid off the balance of account, but they mailed it to my work address, even though I asked that ALL correspondence be sent to my home address when I talked to them last spring. 

The return address is clearly visible to my employer and staff of the office I work at. Also, it is the policy of our office to have staff open the mail before it is delivered. 

Because I have asked multiple times for them to send me correspondence to my home address and not to contact me at work, and because they have repeatedly ignored this request from me, I make this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."

472271,Mortgage,"To Ohio Banking Authorities : PNC Bank has consistently overcharged us on our mortgage since the term started XX/XX/XXXX. In the last 3 years of the 5 year term, they have overcharged us {$400.00}. 
I complained to them a short time ago. I explained I was using the statement they send me every month to calculate the interest and principal. 
For instance, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, they calculated that the interest payable on XXXX XXXX was {$170.00}, and the principal would be {$2900.00}, for a total of {$3100.00}. 
But the next month, they sent me a statement saying that what they actually took out was : interest of {$190.00}, and the principal was actually {$2900.00}. Every month they do the same thing. Charge us a little more than they say they will. 
I complained to them on the phone. My complaint : Every month they change the interest that they charge. It is always a little greater than the posted interest they ask us to pay. It is always changed in their favor. They told us it was due to monthly fluctualions in the calendar. I said the calendar was known when they issued the loan. They refused to address my complaint. 
Our issue is they are overcharging us. When the loan was created, it was a fixed rate loan that never changes. The calendar never changes. How could it change in their favor every month? 
I enclose my statement from XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX. These statements are part of a monthly pattern of price changes in the bank 's favor every month. I have copies of all of the other statements. Again, every month they tell us what will come out on the XXXX of the month. Then the next statement comes out, and they tell us what they took out last time. It is always higher than what they project they will take out. Always. 
My complaint to the bank was basically ignored. But I feel I have been overcharged, and I continue to be overcharged every month. The amount of the difference between what they tell us they will take out, and what the tell us they already took out will soon be over {$500.00}. If they do this to all of their customers, it would be XXXX dollars of excess interest. 

Thank You"

At that point I was then told to cancel the first money gram and submit another XXXX to another supervisor for same amount and the tech would brig me {$850.00} instead of {$420.00}.

359505,Bank account or service,"To whom it may concern, I recently opened an account with Chase bank and I had some unauthorized charges post on my account from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. As a courtesy Chase called me to verify the charges, which I of course said they were unauthorized, then Chase agreed to give me a refund in the meantime while they handled the dispute with the merchants and would send me a new debit card to ensure no further unauthorized charges. All while this is going on, I supposed the "" back office '' of Chase reviewed my account and decided that they no longer would be doing business with me, and chose to close the account. I never received notice of this decision. When I received my new card in the mail, it did n't work and I called in to customer service and was informed of my account being closed. I was never given the reason why, but I told the representative that this would n't work because I had direct deposit coming from my employer that was too late to change. Either way, the closure was n't scheduled for another XXXX business days ( the XXXX business day was today ) so my direct deposit went through just fine. On XXXX XXXX, I went to a Chase branch to withdraw my remaining funds before my account closed and I found out that the Loss Prevention Department put a restriction on my account until the claim disputes I filed were finalized, I would not have access to over {$400.00} dollars until then. When I spoke to the Claims Department they have an estimated time of completion of XXXX XXXX ( the maximum of XXXX days mandated by XXXX ), and because there were restrictions set on my account the Claims department would thoroughly investigate the dispute up to the maximum date. Basically saying, they would hold my money until XXXX XXXX, even though I am able to submit proof that XXXX returned the payment. When I explained the inconvenience, and that I needed the money to pay bills and get to and from work, the representative just apologized, reiterated the policy, and I 'd have to wait until the claim was finalized. 

My issue is all this time Chase knew that they were closing my account but I was still doing transactions at the branches and the tellers/bankers there did not inform me of this decision. Had I not gone into the bank on XXXX XXXX to withdraw all my funds, I would have no idea the restrictions set and Chase 's intent to "" freeze '' my account, in fact, XXXX representative told me I was sent a letter with all that information. 

My issue is that I find all of this to be very underhanded and shady, why would you send me a letter informing me that my account was closing and I would have restrictions on that account, when everything else with Chase is communicated via email and text? Also, the representatives have absolutely no compassion for my issue, or any sense of urgency when I call in and explain that I need my funds to get to work. And the XXXX departments ( Claims and Loss Prevention ), send me back and forth constantly and talk me in circles. If I call Claims, they tell me LP is the department that can help me, then I talk to LP and they try to transfer me back to claims."

I called XXXX office and found that my address was never updated in their system. I specifically remember I provided my new address to them prior to the start of the dental services in XXXX XXXX as I moved to my current address in XXXX XXXX. The office manager XXXX accepted their mistake and told me it is not the office policy to call patients regarding an outstanding payment. I told them to put my account on hold until I gather information from my dental insurance regarding the dues. However, my accout was reported to the credit bureas and my credit score significantly declined. XXXX XXXX 's office failed to communicate to me, failed to update the address and without making effort to contact me submitted my account to collections. My credit score has declined significantly due the failure on XXXX office to follow due procedure. I received threating calls from Capital Accounts every day even after informing them that I am working with the dental office to setlle this issue. I asked them to note that I am working with the dental office however, Capital Accounts informed me that they do not have any instructions from XXXX office.

The school I attended is XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA which does n't exists in that location anymore. 
My mom has been trying to pay off a parent plus loan that has now accumulated to over {$30000.00} because she has been qualified for low income payments. She even qualified for a little more than a year on a program where she had to make $ 0 monthly payments for 10 years and then the loan would be forgiven. Then they requested proof of income from her and because she makes more money than the year before she had to start making {$150.00} payments with an 8.500 % interest rate. I have called on my moms behalf to see if she has any options to lower the interest and they say they do n't but that she only has to pay for 10 years and then her loan would be forgiven, they keep giving her the same story. Based on the owed amount and the interest rate, she will never pay towards the principal any money. I informed them and they said I 'm correct. So I asked them "" are you telling me she is basically only going to pay you interest to hold the loan and never pay the principal? '' And they said yes. I believe they are a huge scam for the practices they are doing because of course my moms credit score is not high, she does n't make enough money and she ca n't get a loan to help her pay off this enormous amount, but they keep getting her into programs that promise to "" help her ''. I have read about predatory lender practices and I believe this is exactly what they are doing to my mother. I have even Googled this service and there are so many complaints out there I believe there should be an end put to them. We are honest people trying to pay off a loan that does n't seem to have an end. To make matters even worse, she just took my younger brother to attend school and they placed a new loan under the same lender. We dont understand why they did that. 
Thank you very much for all your help and your time taken to read my complaint."

Self employed, I only made {$6500.00} the previous year but I had over a XXXX credit score cause I always paid my bills, The Broker said, "" We have to go stated income and that is gona cost you a couple thousand dollars ''. It sounded a little odd but I thought I found the relief I needed. He wanted his appraisers to appraise my property 's even though I had one done on my house not long ago. He completed the application for the rental and gave me a number to call, XXXX in XXXX, to complete the application on the phone. It was all so easy and fast. It 's XXXX, the XXXX housepayment is due XXXX XXXX, {$410.00}. XXXX XXXX statement the payment rose {$70.00}. That was not to happen for XXXX years. Wondering what I got myself into, I drove to the nice looking Mortgage XXXX and it was abandon, completely empty and for rent. I called XXXX and got no answers. So I paid the {$480.00} payment for XXXX years and out the blue, my house payment raises to {$1200.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX has it now. It is XX/XX/XXXX, I just lost my job a week earlier and out the blue, my house payment triples. I ca n't afford that, I call XXXX, they say that 's my new payment, there is nothing they can do.

You have to stop making your payments so you qualify for XXXX of the programs ''. OK, I could n't afford them anyway, what a relief but I had a weird, sick feeling not making my house payment which is XXXX my income of XXXX years earlier. A couple months of horrible, crazy paper chase, XXXX denies the HOPE Mod and pursues foreclosure. HOPE told me I qualified for the mod and to write to the Attorney General. Meantime, I 'm looking for help, find Mortgage Mediators in XXXX and they tell me you get what you pay for, HOPE being free, they charged me {$2000.00} to get a mod, which was my second Mod denial from XXXX. Lawyer after Lawyer, thousands of dollars, all mods getting denied, XXXX presents a deal I could do, but they gave me a fictitious address in XXXX and sent it there and by the time I got it, XXXX sold the servicing to XXXX who gave me a {$2100.00} payment. XXXX denied a couple mods and sold the servicing to XXXX in the middle of the XXXX mod. Under XXXX 's watch, I had a mod denial then denial to let me apply for a mod.

The collection agency received the letter on XX/XX/XXXX but has not responded to my request for original documents and have since stopped contacting me. 

I am concerned that CU Recovery Inc. is not a legal entity or that it is trying to stall the process to settled in order to hike fees and other interests, specially since they have not responded to my debt validation request claims and the amount they say I owe does not reflect the amount reported in my credit report by XXXX XXXX XXXX this month.

475917,Consumer Loan,"On several occasions as a borrower, I have attempted to call both the local and head offices of this company, CashNetUSA, to find out what my balance was. I may have done this within just a few days of my last payment, but was told that information was not available to me. I would have to wait until the close of the next billing cycle in case there are "" changes. '' I argued that there are changes all the time to the balances in my checking account, and the bank has no problem making those real-time immediate updates. 

During XXXX of my inquiries, when I wanted to know what my balance would be in about XXXX weeks from that date IF I did NOT use my flex loan amount to take out any funds from my account. 

I could not be provided that information either, but evidently the representative was slightly rattled and "" almost ' '' told me what my balance would be on that date if n further transactions occurred. 

Seems t me if banks and credit card companies and and DO provide this up to the minute, real time financial data to it 's customers, there is no reason CashNetUSA could not do the same thing. 

What was the purpose, I wanted to know, in this "" XXXX '' the company kept from it 's customers? As I saw it, the customer had the right AT ALL TIMES to know what their actual balance was. 

I got nowhere on any of my attempts and so I am brining my complaint to you. 

Frankly, I think CashNetUSA is taking liberties with the funds of its customers, but with so little forward and backward account documentation to go on, it is hard to tell. 

Is that perhaps, by design??"

My problems are these : 1 ) The name of the company has changed at least once, if not twice, since this has been going on. 2 ) I suspect this has something to do with an earlier complaint through the BCFP about another company who was fraudulently attempting to service the same loan. 3 ) relating to 2 ), it appears as if this company has colluded with other companies to collect on a single debt. 4 ) When I attempt to reach this company, by way of a XXXX search, the outgoing message does not include the name of the company as it appears in my banking statement.

409976,Bank account or service,"My debit card was taken from me the beginning of this month and was used to make purchases and withdrawals that were unauthorized by me. When Chase Bank finally notified me of these transactions they assured me that my card was frozen and that I would be receiving a new XXXX in the mail. I come to find the next day that my card was still being used, this time to make online purchases and apparently someone called on my behalf and was able to reactivate my debit card over the phone. I do not believe the representative on the other line asked this person any type of security question because if they did this person would have never been able to obtain the information I provided for the security questions. Later on in that week I was mortified to find out that my bank account was suddenly in the negatives. My money was taken from me and replaced with fake checks that eventually bounced. These checks were forged with my name and I 'm still wondering how this person was able to deposit checks into my account without showing someone a proper form of identity since my ID is still in my possession. I made several claims after that regarding my checking and savings account and all the activity that transpired over a matter of just a few days. The representatives on the phone were rude and very unsympathetic and whenever I called to find out the status of the investigation no one could give me a straight answer which left me on the phone for over an hour. Chase also sent me emails claiming that they would temporarily refund me the money that was taken out of my account and that I had full access to this money until the investigation was over. Later on I came to realize that this was completely untrue, my account was in the process of being closed and that I had no access to it whatsoever.

To date, the company still shows the account as charged off and rarely updates the balance due. I pay my regular note each month and they are still reporting as a charge off. According to the definition, a charge off is considered uncollectable debt. My biggest concern is that it should show an updated status versus charge off. Also, the lender may have written this debt off but collected the credits at year-end that came with the write off.

SPS sent me a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating they received my appeal and they would respond to me within 30 days. I then received a denial of my appeal on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The problem and illegal action for which I am complaining is that SPS recorded a Notice of XXXX against my property on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. According to my attorney, RESPA Reg X ( 1024.41 ) States no foreclosure action shall be ordered while a borrower is under an active review for loss mitigation. My appeal was not yet denied and I had not cancelled my request for appeal or review. The fact that they recorded a notice of sale on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which is 6 days before I was denied, is against Respa Regulations. In addition the denial letter makes no sense and basically confirms that they could appprove an affordable payment that is below XXXX % of my income. It also confirms they are using the wrong interest rate for my review. My current interest rate is 2.75 %. However, as you can see in the letter they are using my contractually due interest rate of 7.75 %. This is not how the guidelines are written. The review must use the current interest rate of the loan and not the interest rate of my loan from XX/XX/XXXX. SPS is basically just making up excuses and at the same time dual tracking my foreclosure. PLEASE ENFORCE RESPS REG X. What is the point of having Respa regulations without doing anything to enforce it. This CLEARLY shows on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX they confirmed my review was open and under review ( See attached letter ). How can they record a Notice of Sale on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX? RESPA Reg X states that the only way they can order a Notice of Sale to be recorded is after the appeal is denied or after I have advised them I am no longer appealing the denial. I never advised them I was cancelling my appeal. There are no questions regarding the timeline. They simply violated Respa Reg X by fling the Notice of Sale on that date. My attorney tells me that every time this happens, the servicer simply does nothing and continues with the foreclosure. CFPB does nothing except collect information and then I lose my home. CFPB in my opinion should demand the servicer rescind the Notice of Sale and re- record it if necessary after the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX date. Otherwise I am advising both CFPB and SPS that this home will be foreclosed illegally and I will pursue all legal action to reverse and cloud the title after the foreclosure if the Notice of Sale is not rescinded and re-recorded legally."
468325,Payday loan,"In XX/XX/XXXX I received a loan from Dollar Loan Center in XXXX, CA. I was assisted by employees XXXX and XXXX at the time of applying. During the process I asked both XXXX and XXXX what were the XXXX tables their company charge in interest. I was never given any XXXX explanation from XXXX or XXXX. From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I paid XXXX dollars on a XXXX dollar loan. I called numerous times to speak with XXXX and XXXX to ask why the principal of the loan does n't reduce after each by-weekly payment of XXXX dollars and what was in interest charge I was paying since no one explained the APR on the loans they offer. I was never given a clear response from either employee. I was notified after calling every week in XX/XX/XXXX that the XXXX rate I was charged for the loan is XXXX %. I was very upset that I was never informed of the APR associated with the loan. I had maid on time payments for XXXX months not knowing the exact interest I was bring charged. This is very shady and deceptive business practices by Dollar Loan Center. I asked XXXX why she did n't answer my initial question of the XXXX that her company charges. I was told by XXXX that they can only explain their fees by a daily fee charge. I asked XXXX what XXXX in percentage will be to calculate the interest charge. She refused to do so. I never received any documentation explaining I will be charged XXXX % for the loan. I experienced a economic set back that would make it difficult to make the high payments I was making each month. I called and spoke with XXXX and explained the situation to her. I was informed by XXXX that Dollar Loan Center does not work with their customers to make payment arrangements or help reduce the interest. I was told to speak with her XXXX XXXX. XXXX informed me that if I wanted to terminate the loan i would need to pay back the whole XXXX dollars and that the XXXX dollars I have already paid was interest on the loan. Now, After speaking with XXXX, I received daily phone calls from XXXX and XXXX to make payments on the loan after explaining to them that I ca n't and need their help to arrange something but they refused. The phone calls continued daily from different phone numbers and even blocked and private numbers. I asked XXXX why was he calling me from a blocked number if he is calling to collect a debt. I was told by XXXX Dollar Loan Center makes that decision. My wife was also called numerous times even though she was never part of the loan or application. I asked XXXX why he and XXXX are calling my wife and giving out my personal information to her if she is not part of the loan. XXXX replied he can tell her anything since I am married to her. I informed XXXX that is not correct. I was told by XXXX if I had a problem with that to call his XXXX XXXX. Now, Dollar Loan Center is threatening to sue me for XXXX dollars after I have already paid XXXX in payments."

535073,Debt collection,"I arrived to USA two years ago following the American dream and the reunification with my mother and my fianc. 
Months after my arrival my fianc got pregnant and having no place to live together we decide to search for a place to so. The rents were so expensive that my salary and lack of credit history at that moment was not enough to cover all the expenses and we thought it could be better to invest in a property. 
With the help of my uncle we subscribed to all existing governmental institutions as XXXX but purchasing through this institution was not possible since every time we found something according to our necessities and resource the bid was not sufficient. After expending months trying to purchase this way and having no luck I decided to purchase through the XXXX a foreclosure property. 
My uncle requested a home line of credit over his already full paid house, {$150000.00}. Finally with that money I was able to make the purchase for a XXXX home on XXXX XXXX. The house was in pretty bad conditions and needed a lot of fixing which I did my self with help from my family and friends at a cost of around {$50000.00}. 
On XXXX this year I tried to pay my property taxes and to my surprise they were already paid so I contact the payee and requested an explanation. They never came back to me with an answer but instead a few months after I received a visit from an individual advising me that the house would be foreclosed in a few days. I never received a notice or citation. My address and information was register at the county since I obtained a title certificate signed by the court. 
To my surprise I purchased a second loan. If the house was on the market for sale for few years and no one purchased why the first lender did waited for the second mortgage to foreclose. I would agree if there was a lien on the property for other matters but for a mortgage? 
I look at it as a bank scam. I have lived on the premises for a year and a half and after that time and after my claims to the property taxes payee is when the other lender wants to claim. 
Now the bank wants me to pay {$200000.00}. The house is not even worth that amount and if you add the {$200000.00} I already invested the total would have bought me a brand new home. 
The new constructions in the county could be only afforded by reach people then what is it left for the medium class families? 
I would like you to understand that I 'm not an investor that I purchased because my family needed a place to live. I do n't want to lose the house. I own my uncle {$150000.00}, that there are not affordable rents or constructions. That all is left are pure foreclosures and now I should pay for it {$400000.00}. I 'm a young person working and studding at the same time so as my fianc and doing our best to raise our daughter."

755491,Bank account or service,"I went into my local chase bank and used one of their new atm machines inside the bank that they have been encouraging us to use because it seems they are cutting back on labor and replacing actual humans with machines. 
I was depositing XXXX dollars and the machine took my money and provided me with a receipt that said the machine malfunctioned and to talk to the bank or call and make a claim. Now it is beyond me why the machine did not return my money if it malfunctioned. The machine does not require an envelope or a deposit slip which to me is crazy since now there is no written record of my deposit. I immediately talked to a teller and then sat with them to call and make a claim for the money that has basically disappeared. I was told that they would have someone come out within 12 hours and recover the money and that it was separated inside the machine and that it would not be an issue. This deposit was made on the XXXX of XXXX 2016. I received an email yesterday from the bank saying they finsished their research and said that they only recovered XXXX and would be taking XXXX out of my account on XXXX/XXXX/16. there is no research documents on how they came up with this number. I called and asked and was just told that that 's what they determined with no explanation except that 's how much money they recovered. No date of when, how, who or anything. They told me that I would have to go to the bank branch and figure it out. 

Needless to say I 'm going to be out! XXXX because the bank just robbed me. How am I supposed to prove how much money I put in there when there is no deposit slip required? This is going to be a huge financial burden and I 'm at a loss. I will be heading to the bank now to try and rectify this. Hopefully"
616547,Debt collection,"My payments on this debt are not being reported accurately. This debt began as a private student loan I took out while I was in graduate school. I finished graduate school XX/XX/XXXX and had no job and no other income. I defaulted on the debt because I had no way to make the payments. 
As soon as I was able to get a job and get back on my feet, I began making payments on this debt. I have made monthly payments for over XXXX years now, for a total of over {$6000.00} in payments. I still have over {$9000.00} left to pay on the debt. I have asked the lender for a rehabilitation option or some other way to get this debt back in good standing ( since most student loans have that option ), but they always tell me they do n't offer a rehabilitation option. 
Although I always make a payment of {$200.00} each month on this debt, this debt is reported every month as "" Past Due. '' There is no way to tell from my credit report that I am making monthly payments on this debt. This company has agreed to accept $ XXXX monthly, and I pay them $ XXXX monthly. That agreement should be reflected on my credit report as "" pays as agreed. '' Instead, I look like a deadbeat who does n't pay her bills. I just want my payments reflected accurately on my credit report. 
What makes the situation even more ridiculous is the fact that my father, who filed bankruptcy XX/XX/XXXX, has a better credit score than I do. I have made sacrifices and delayed goals like buying a house so I can pay off this debt. Even though I 'm doing the right thing by paying this debt off, I feel like I 'm being punished. Should I have just wiped out the debt instead by filing bankruptcy too? The way my credit report looks it seems like that would have been smarter. 
This debt is scheduled to stay on my credit report until at least XX/XX/XXXX. I 'm making payments every month. I just want those payments reflected accurately so I can move on from ruining my credit five years ago."

Recently, we locked in a 2.75 % rate with Citibank for a Refi of the same property. As mentioned no late payments ever and perfect credit record and over XXXX XXXX score for both my wife and I. We already got approved in XXXX XXXX for a HELO loan on this same property by CITIBANK. 
This loan is approximately a 35 % Loan to Value of property loan based on their last year 's appraisal, so minimal risk to the bank. We have owned the property for 12 years. 
The lock in period expires on XXXX and there have been no changes or misrepresentation on my part and a better XXXX than before. They offered me a credit of .375 % and I would pay appraisal which they charged my card. Also, If i had {$50000.00} in our Citibank account before close that would give me another 1/8 % discount on interest rate. We have regular balances of $ XXXX in our Citibank account anyways. The initial Loan Estimate was dated XXXX but had errors of not reflecting my loan credits and them adding the .75 % as points not a credit of .375 % It took them until XXXX XXXX, XXXX to correct the Loan Estimate! I also provided them a bank statement they required from XXXX XXXX XXXX showing another {$29000.00} in deposits for proof to get the further interest discount of 1/8 % and I told them more would be deposited to make the $ XXXX for the discount and if I could not then the interest rate would be 1/8 % more. 
Here is initial offer email. : XXXX, I pulled up a current balance of {>= $1,000,000} ***Current payment is {$4800.00},,,, Current rate is XXXX,,,,,,,,,,, Savings over $ 500+ XXXX Arm Rates for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for the same loan amount, no increase. 

2.875 % = {$4300.00} = .125 % cost ( ( no relationship pricing ) ) 2.75 % = {$4300.00} 2.625 % = {$4200.00} With a $ XXXX Relationship : 2.75 % = {$4300.00} and .375 % Lender Credits for closing costs ( {$3900.00} ) ///////////// payment = {$4300.00} The saving to me would be {$500.00} a month!

File was withdrawn based on that. Fees to be refunded as we can not offer the same rate. 

Thank you, NOIA means : "" Notice of Incomplete Application '',,, we were sent that let on XXXX XXXX. The revised LE was not corrected until XXXX XXXX, sent to you XXXX XXXX. The banks position is the Assets stmt 's requested needed to be in house or they would withdraw/cancel loan. **I 'm just the messenger on this, I will watch rates constantly for you should they go back that level. 



XXXX XXXX Home Lending Officer Citibank , N.A . 

It is obvious that they do not want to give me the loan because they would lose {$500.00} a month in interest. I have no adverse credit and have been their customer for 8 years with excellent payment record. 
In their rate lock confirmation letter they state it can be canceled only if I dont disclose material facts or adverse change in credit, employment, income, assets or liabilities or they can not verify my eligibility or if I made false statements ... ... NONE OF THESE HAVE OCCURED and they approved me for Home equity loan on same house only Six months ago! This rate rate lock does not expire until XXXX yet they have rejected me even though I have the same loan with them since XXXX! got a HELOC approved six months ago and the monthly payment will be LESS by {$500.00} a month! 

I would love to understand Citibank logic other than illegally them not wanting to give me a {$500.00} a month less mortgage thanks"

I saw a sign outside another trailer park offering a 4.93 % mortgage rate in big letters with 21st mortgage 's insignia on it and this rate was confirmed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX staff. When I applied for refinancing from my 9.9 % mortgage, they told me that the lowest rate for financing for all credit scores was 10.8 %. I asked 21st mortgage company if they knew about the sign and they said that it was false advertising and it did n't exist. I took a picture and sent it to them and received no response. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX told me that 21st mortgage provided them with the sign to put up. The second suspicious moment occurred when I was denied a refinancing opportunity and I received an email stating that I could restructure my loan if I paid them {$2000.00}. When I asked what was meant by that statement, the agent, XXXX XXXX, refused to elaborate and said he would take care of it. I got denied refinancing and he asked for money. Is n't that fishy? I do n't know what that means. It seems to me that something either I do n't understand is going on or the company is trying to take advantage of people."

I suspect that either the debt was fraudulently obtained using my information, or the collection agency is fraudulently trying to collect a fictitious debt. 

This debt has been reported to credit rating agencies and is severely impairing my credit score/history. 

I have filed a police report with local county office, and they asked me to follow up with CFPB ; hence this report. 

I would urge you to investigate both Ad Astra and XXXX XXXX as to the origins of these collection letters."

187761,Bank account or service,"US Bank accepted a deposit of a {$7200.00} XXXX XXXX check at its ATM on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for our checking account. Shelter 's issuing bank is XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX. On the morning of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX our online access account information showed the funds available. This check was to replace the total loss of our XXXX XXXX XXXX When we tried to buy a replacement vehicle, the transaction was denied. When we called US Bank customer service, we were told a Fraud alert was place on account but we could go to a local branch to have the funds released at the manager 's discretion. That XXXX branch manager, said it must be done by our designated home branch manager. That manager said it would need to be released by the Fraud department. 
The Fraud department told us they tried to call XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX to verify the funds. When the XXXX bank refused, as they were instructed by XXXX XXXX to refer the call to their Home Office, the Fraud department place a hold on our account for seven business days. 
After XXXX hours of customer service, fraud, and local branch phone calls, we were told the branch manager of our home branch had the power and discretion to release the funds. XXXX at the local branch said we needed to have someone from the issuing bank verify the funds. We had the XXXX XXXX Home Office manager in charge of clearing checks, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, talk to the local branch teller, XXXX and branch manager, XXXX, XXXX, to verify the funds. The XXXX bank called them as well. 
The branch manager, XXXX, told us she would not release the funds, even after the money was received from the issuing bank due to bank fraud concerns. 
In the meantime, our account remains suspended. The branch manager claims their action is for our own protection and their against fraud. We are new to their bank, less than a year, but the excuses we received make me shake my head in wonder. Because we are newer accountholders, and the size of the check is larger than previously deposited, and the fraud department made the security determination, they would not accept the assurances of the other bank, the insurance company or us that this was not a fraudulent transaction and used the protocol of holding funds to shield their actual discretion. 
Amoung the numerous calls we made and the in person experience at the XXXX branch, we were told the funds would be released on the XXXX, XXXX and then XXXX. They are sticking with the XXXX. 
US Bank is holding our funds hostage to prevent the purchase of the replacement car, groceries, and whatever else we might need for the principle of fraud protection. 
I own a home, I have my XXXX children, and my wife has her XXXX children. We are both employed. We previously transacted our banking with a credit union. The replacement vehicle is essential to our health, well being and employment. The implication of their anti-fraud effort is insulting and unnecessary. They obviously do n't want our business, but they also need to release these funds. XXXX XXXX already released the funds so they can not replace the check issued for this deposit."

384536,Credit card,"I maintain a credit card account and pay each month in full, no balance carried. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016 an email message was received stating that there was a balance of {$780.00} and this amount was being deducted from my checking account on the day prior to the email notification just received. After lengthy telephone wait and conversation, a Synchrony supervisor said there were thousands of incorrect/erroneous billing notices emailed to their customers - but that they were taking no action to alert clients, or to send memos stating that the bills were in NOT order and that they could be safely ignored. 

I insisted on receiving confirmation in writing - and did receive an apology - but nothing stating that the bill was an error on their part. 

Now, a month later, another such letter has been received. Again, it is stated that we owe {$780.00} and that it would be deducted from my checking account, deduction to occur three days prior to receiving this notice. In contacting Synchrony agan, and waiting an extended time, I spoke to a Supervisor who said there is a system problem, nothing they can do about it, clients are NOT being notified of the error, and it will continue until it is fixed by their "" back line '' people - whomever, whatever that is. I asked to speak to a Manager, but was told, after another extended wait, that there was no manager present. However, that a manager would call me. 

Had I not been on AutoPay, receipt of the initial memo would have likely caused me to overpay and send in the {$780.00} to avoid a late pay situation. Synchrony may be sending out these erroneous notices, and receiving extra payments from clients who have no idea that the bills are completely wrong. In addition, it would seem that the consumer has risk of bad credit report information being submitted by Synchrony based on their broken system. 

This problem needs to be fixed quickly. It has extended beyond one month. Consumers need to be notified that Synchrony has this problem, and that the consumer 's account and credit report will not be affected. And, Synchrony should be fined for their failure to properly notify affected clients."

I spoke to a XXXX there and provided an email with the check numbers and dates of the settlement payments and advised her that this was a time-barred lease agreement. According to California Code of Civil Procedure section 337, that the landlord was long past the four years statutes of limitations. She thanked me for the information and said she would pass it along to XXXX, the leasing company. I had not heard anything else back from her. Yesterday, on XX/XX/XXXX, I went to purchase a vehicle and to my surprise, my credit score dropped from 780 to 650 due to a bad/false claim from FCS for {$18000.00}. This effected my interest rate on the purchase costing me well over {$1000.00} of interest on my future payments. I contacted FCS this morning with my disappointment and prior to hanging up on me, they said "" do not call back ''."

The is reaching maturity and I was investigating an extension for 1-3 months while I waited for my XXXX Volt to arrive, which has suffered from production delays. When I contacted Ally to get an extension, I was told the monthly payment would increase by over 50 % and there would be no additional mileage allowance. I have leased several cars in the past and never experienced this kind of behavior. In the past, the other finance companies simply extended the lease on a month-by-month basis at the same monthly payment offered under the terms of the lease contract, and they included additional miles based on XXXX of the annual mileage allowance as specified in the lease contract. Ally is doing none of this. 
Ally Bank used to be XXXX XXXX, a division of XXXX, before getting spun off in the early XXXX 's. It was announced earlier this year that XXXX is going to move their leasing programs back in-house with a new XXXX XXXX division. Is it possible Ally is penalizing XXXX customers for this change? 
Regardless, I have found their behavior to be highly questionable. Beyond the issues listed above in attempting to get an extension, Ally also took the extra step of deleting all online access to my account after the final lease payment was made, despite the fact I still have possession of the vehicle. I lost all access to my payment history and account details."

I immediately paid the debt that had grown to {$810.00} with penalties and fees. I contacted the State of XXXX and they agreed to cancel the lien from record because there was no real notification that the debt was ever owed. I sent this documentation to all three credit reporting agencies. XXXX and XXXX did an investigation and removed the lien from my file immediatly. Equifax , however refuses to remove the item. I have requested 3 times by certified mail the name and contact information from a person at the XXXX Department of Revenue that is stating this record still exists, but have received no response. I can only conclude they have done no investigation. I have contacted XXXX Department of Revenue to follow up and they tell me they can do nothing from their end if Equifax is still reporting it. 
I am XXXX years old and this is the ONLY derogatory item on my credit record. My State and Federal taxes are paid in full. I am in the mortgage industry as a profession and have to be licensed in every state I conduct business. There are states that will not give me a license because of this derogatory item.

A concern I have is that I was never notified of denial of dispute. If I would not called today then this dispute would have never been resolved. I was told the reason it was denied it was because "" I did not provide any documentation ''. Also I never received any paperwork in the mail. Well there is nothing to provide since I did not sign any receipts. You guys ca n't just go around denying customers claims and thinking nobody will call back and in this particular case deny it on a basis that it needs documentation from me. What happens if the customer does not have any documents you just deny the claim it sounds wrong!!! Somebody is not doing his or her job correctly and this needs further investigation. How about calling the merchant and asking them for signed receipts!!! Why do n't you do that? I did not do any pin confirmation either. Talk to the person who did the dispute and I think this is the person that needs to be looked at. I do n't ' think this person is doing his/her job properly. Maybe is time to let this person go because is causing customers accounts to be closed. 
I want my credit on my account. If I do n't get a credit I will close it and further complaint to the XXXX, FTC, and CFPB and let them investigate your practices and maybe they will find out you are not following proper rules.

I went into the branch and called the customer service line and they just explained that the policy is to charge anything over {$5.00}. I VERY rarely overdraw my account, and thought the bank would take care of its customers in a better manner than charging {$37.00} for an overdraft of less than {$7.00}. In addition, I made a cash deposit the very next day to cover the overdraft situation because I do n't like ever being in an overdrawn situation. This seems outrageous, and I believe the Truth in Savings regulation should be updated to no longer allow any overdraft fee greater than the amount actually overdrawn."

I had a XXXX month lease and it will be up in about 5 months. That following week after we got the call, we decided to bring the car in and get it inspected to see if it would qualify into their early return and exchange program. We waited in the dealership while the car is being checked and several hours after that the agent came back and advised us that everything is good and the car was inspected and checked and it is qualified for the said program and that we can select another car or a totally different car and they will take care of terminating the existing lease and the remaining lease and terms. 
We had chosen to upgrade from a XXXX to an XXXX and they asked us to pay for the additional funds to get to the chosen car and we then went on to sign up for a new lease and this time for more monthly payment.

Four months later, we received a call from someone at XXXX XXXX advising us that we owe them over {$3000.00} for excess mileage. and we argued to them that we do not believe it so because the dealership did not adrress it then in XXXX 2015 when we exchanged the XXXX to the new XXXX into their so called early return and exchange program and their inspecttion should have addressed that before we even get lured into signing for a new lease. Had we known that then, we should not have gotten into their bait and switch and that they are misleading the consumers and come back to it after the fact and almost to a point of no recourse. 
Honestly, our original plan was to keep the XXXX hybrid lease because of low fuel consumption and we would have gotten it re-written to a purchase but because we were misled the other way, they had induced us to sign up for a lease that is from a {$390.00} to a {$680.00} monthly and they are asking us to pay {$3700.00} thru a collection agency - XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ext XXXX as per letter recived from XXXX XXXX of this outfit."

My spouse is an XXXX XXXX XXXX who had a portion of his loans repaid pursuant to the XXXX loan repayment program. In XXXX XXXX, Navient misapplied a payment received from XXXX and mistakenly paid down my loans instead of my spouse 's loans. The mistake was discovered in XXXX XXXX. To correct the error, Navient removed the XXXX {$30000.00} payment that was applied to three of my loans. It has not yet credited my spouse with the {$30000.00}. The issue I have is that Navient has now put me in a delinquent status ( having allegedly missed 33 payments even though no payments were due XXXX. They "" may '' have assessed late fees against my account dating back to XXXX, and have also assessed interest dating back to XXXX. That is not right. Navient made the mistake in XXXX, and now they are asking me to pay for it. Had they not made the mistake, I would have been making payments and paying off the principal and interest. My account history for the loans shows no activity between the time the XXXX payment was misapplied and now, so I have no idea what their reasoning and legal authority is for placing the financial burden of their mistake on me. I am assuming Navient will reapply the {$30000.00} it received from XXXX in XXXX to my spouse 's account, but I question the manner in which they will do it. They should back date the payment to XXXX and only charge interest going forward from now for the corrected balance, but we will see."

This rate had the following assumptions posted : loan to value of 95 % for used vehicle, excellent credit history, and loan amount of XXXX. After submitting my application, I received a quoted rate of 4.79 %. I requested to speak to the underwriter who told me that the high rate was due to the loan to value for the auto loan. I asked them to update the loan amount to reflect the 95 % loan to value for my requested vehicle ( XXXX ). She updated the application and came back with a quoted rate of 2.79 %. I asked her why my rate was still not the advertised 2.06 % and she said because I my loan was n't using the specific model/year in the assumptions. I believe this is a clear instance of bait and switch tactics as there 's probably such a minuscule probability that an applicant have the exact vehicle model/year, credit score, and Chase checking account to qualify for the advertised rate."

I have n't heard from them till 3 months ago and they would leave dozens of herassing phone calls. Apparently what happened is they did n't give me the correct balance to pay off. They said I still had a balance due. They state that I owe them the remaining balance with interest. They used the large sum of money I sent them earlier to make minimum payments over the XXXX years, and I am now past due. They never once sent me a statement in the XXXX years saying I owed any money. So in short, I thought I paid my loan off XXXX years ago, and today I am told I owe over {$10000.00} on a balance of {$7100.00} from XXXX years ago. They are refusing to work with me and when I ask them to send me paper info in the mail they say ok. In 3 months I have n't received any paperwork, other then the monthly statements they are now sending.

We were approved for a modification and made our first trial plan payment XX/XX/XXXX. We successfully made our 3 trial plan payments and continued to make payments to the mortgage company after the trial ended. We started calling them XX/XX/XXXX as we had not received our completed modification papers to make the modification permanent. We spoke to our relationship manager three to four times a month requesting our paperwork. We were always told that the paperwork was with the underwriter and we should have it "" soon ''. We finally received our paperwork XX/XX/XXXX. We had the papers notarized on XX/XX/XXXX at the bank where I included a cashier 's check for the monthly payment as Ocwen had requested and mailed the papers that day. When I called in XX/XX/XXXX to make my house payment I was told that my loan modification was denied because they did n't receive the paperwork within the allotted time frame of 30 days. When the customer service representative looked into it further we were told that they had in fact received our paperwork on XX/XX/XXXX and that the modification was denied on XXXX XXXX. When we asked why they told us it was because the lender had that right. We called numerous time after that and we were told that it was being sent to a supervisor and that they would fix it. I tried to make a house payment in XX/XX/XXXX and they once again would not accept my payment due to the denial. On XX/XX/XXXX I received notification that my loan had been referred to a law firm for foreclosure. We never received anything from Ocwen stating that we were in foreclosure. When I spoke to yet a different customer service representative I was told to just fill out another request for modification. I did that and submitted a complete application XX/XX/XXXX which was later denied because we had submitted a XXXX application within a years ' time. In XX/XX/XXXX I was told by another representative to send an email to the escalations department asking them to look at the original denial. On XX/XX/XXXX we received notice that the denial was overturned and that they were approving our modification. I was able to talk to our relationship manager on XX/XX/XXXX who told me that he had to ask the research department to confirm that we had made all of our payments. About a week later we received documents in the mail showing payment history starting XX/XX/XXXX but none of the payments from XX/XX/XXXX. Ocwen is now telling us that we are in default again due to no payments being accepted by them since XX/XX/XXXX. As of this week our relationship manager is still unable to give us any information as to how we are to proceed from here. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions that you can offer at this point.

Chase credit card makes the late fee charge very tricky. and take advantage of consumers who have busy schedule and have no ability to understand their complicated statement and policy and never send an alert email regarding payment due. As I logged in my chase credit card because of other issues one day after the due day, I found the big late fee charge and contacted them and informed I would paid full balance today and asked them to reverse the late fee charge. They made the statement complicated and not friendly easy, therefore I spent a lot of time understanding it. Thought I still dont understand it, I have no choice but pay the full balance +big late fee charge. But I believe it is unfair to treat consumers in a tricky way since their policy and statements are complicated and never send alert email to consumer to remind them regarding due day and never explain late fee policy."

During the process we were required to pay for the appraisal and inspection for the home. We also gave the bank our deposit. They gave us a conditional approval letter which I believed was unfair since it requested to pay for a cosigned student loans that were not mine. When they realized that and requested the documentation of that it was indeed a cosigned loan, i provided all documentation they asked for. I also did everything else they asked for like taking the home owner class and opening an account with TD bank.

To me this is crazy because the information about my work they had since day XXXX almost 3 months ago. To waist my time, money and energy and cause extreme emotional distresssince I was left homeless to scramble to find a place to live in a week. That call was the last time I heard from them with no real explanation and its been 2 weeks with no official letter or call. There is no justification is to mislead and discriminate against me claiming information you had from the beginning about my income which was obviously enough to get me the pre approval along with my credit and to even call and tell me that I have the loan as well as my realtor. To lie to me, give me false hope which i made decision based on and that concern my life and my family 's on is horrific! To be at the finish line and to pull the rug out from under me is a disgrace!. I believe that their decision was based on the fact that I am a Woman and a minority. There is no justification to excuse what TD bank has given. They should be refunding every expense that I had to make with regards to this messy situation, our deposit, the appraisal which we never got the report from them on, the inspections, the moving expenses and the realors fees etc. I am out of a place to live which I loved. TD bank needs to do whats right for what they did. Shame on them."

I have been with Ocwen for around 7 years or so and I have had insurance via XXXX XXXX for the entire time I have owned the property. 

For the past 2 years, they have been doing the following things : 1. Calling me at least 2 x per day 2. Sending me letters saying, 'You have received this letter because you have not paid your bill. If you have paid your bill by the time you receive this letter, then disregard this letter ' 3. Sending me packets of XXXX page booklets saying, 'You are going to go into foreclosure. For help, fill out these forms and call us at Ocwen to assist ' They have charged me for insurance without even telling me about it, messing with my Escrow. When I realized this, I fought with them and had to get XXXX XXXX on a conference call with Ocwen again. 

In the meantime, when I call them back ( it takes 45 minutes + of wait time ) to get on the phone with them, then they tell me different stories : Story 1 : you need to pay insurance Story 2 : you owe us {$400.00} ( but they wo n't say for what ) Story 3 : your payment went up XXXX dollars per month since XX/XX/XXXX ( but they wo n't say for what- I think it is for insurance by piecing the phone call responses together ) All I want is this : 1. To STOP HARASSING ME! Do I need to sue for HARASSMENT? 
2. To stop being ignored 3. Reimbursement for insurance 4. No charging for fees that are snuck in without even telling me about it 5. Stop sending me letters ( see above ) 6. Stop sending me XXXX page packets ( see above ) 7. Tell me what they actually want WRITTEN in a clear EMAIL WITH STATEMENTS FOR PROOF 8. Stop calling me I have escalated my concerns to the entire Board of Directors and CEO and VP : XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX at Ocwen with Zero response, except for more paper and convoluted phone calls. 

The latest is that an Ocwen employee called me and told me 'all I can do is listen to your complaint but can not help you ', then she was so rude, and played a game with me by saying 'you wo n't let me read you my disclosure so I ca n't help you and because you called me, I do n't know who you are ' Why even call me? I told her if she was going to play that game, then she can just call me back. Then she said she was not going to call me back. I told her that this was ridiculous we were even having this conversation because I asked simply for the company to respond via email to my email requests. She was so sarcastic and rude, telling me that she could only just listen but do nothing to help. What a waste of time, like this is some sort of a joke? I was so angry and upset XXXX, as this has been happening for months now that I let her have it. She kept talking over me so I hung up. This is abuse. I just want them to tell me what they want via email with statements so they can communicate like a NORMAL company would!

I made 22 phone calls and spent two and a half hours in the office with my adviser, plus numerous amounts of research on my own time to get this situation straightened out regarding my mortgage company, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing to resolve this situation. The final straw for me was when they raised my repayment plan amount from the agreed upon {$1200.00} to {$1300.00} when I called them to make my XX/XX/XXXX payment. The only response I could get, when asked why, is that 'This is what the system is telling us '. Upon, finally reaching the escrow department, they informed me, the payment was being increased because I had to pay the outstanding tax balance, while they waited for the refund ( from the county ). The mortgage company had made the correction in XX/XX/XXXX. It was at this time, ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I contacted my adviser. He spoke with Shellpoint Mortgage and told them we were going to file a suit and report them to CFBP. I had heard nothing yet, by XX/XX/XXXX ; and wanted to get this situation resolved before I made my XX/XX/XXXX payment. Once again, three phone calls got me nowhere, except "" We are working on this. '' I reiterated that I would be starting law suit proceedings and referring them to CBFP. Amazingly, later that afternoon, the supervisor called me directly to state that the escrow situation had been cleared up and the remaining eight months of my repayment plan would be {$1100.00}.

Now they came up with a very questionable loan modification where the original amount went from {$45000.00} to {$100000.00} due to some very questionable fees. So now I owe as much as my first mortgage. It does n't make any sense. What about all the payments I did submit? Do n't they count for something?

_ The car was in perfect condition when I gave back to Toyota. 
_ I paid all the services for that vehicle in Toyota 's service department, according with their own maintenance schedule. 
_ I paid the last month, even though I use the car only for 15 days. 
_ More important, I gave back the vehicle without using XXXX XXXX miles, that I was entitled to use ; therefore, Toyota has a big plus, because with the saving of that mileage Toyota gets, at least, {$2000.00} or {$3000.00} more when they sell the car.

Between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I had a balance on the Macy 's store card of {$120.00}. I paid that balance off on XXXX XXXX. Because I had a balance between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I was charged a "" MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE '' of {$2.00}. 

I called Macy 's to inquire about this {$2.00} charge since I have never seen it before and certainly not what I signed up for. To my surprise, their automated phone system gave me the option of removing that {$2.00} interest charge as a "" courtesy ''. 

I believe this this practice to be illegal since the interest on a {$120.00} for 4 days that the balance carried over with my current APR of 24.75 % is no where close to {$2.00}.

When I looked through the past statements, I found that I have been being charged a minimum {$2.00} per month interest charge even though I have not purchased anything on this card. Is this legal?? This makes me wonder how many times I have paid this questionable charge unknowingly. I can only see the last six months online, and all dollars I have paid to Macy 's within this time frame have been strictly for this charge. I suspect they may have been posting this charge on my account for even longer. 

I fully paid off my balance owed XX/XX/XXXX, and since then I have not made any purchases, I did not expect to have owed anything. I only have made payments when Macy 's emailed to notify me. I also noticed that Macy 's has dropped my credit limit to {$100.00} from {$600.00}, surely due to my late payments of these questionable interest charges. How is it I am being charged interest on nothing purchased? Once I paid off my balance in XX/XX/XXXX, I was still assessed this iffy charge XX/XX/XXXX, and then monthly ever since.

204153,Mortgage,"On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I applied for a HARP refinance loan with Homeward Residential ( Homeward ). I was told I would not need an appraisal for my refinance. I received my initial and ONLY Loan Estimate ( LE ) from Homeward on XXXX/XXXX/2016. A copy is attached. The LE does not include an estimated charge for an appraisal. It does include a general lender credit of {$180.00}. This lender credit reduces the cost of the loan and as such is a closing cost subject to zero tolerance under 12 CFR 1026.19 ( e ) ( 3 ). 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received an e-mail ( copy attached ) from the loan officer indicating that an appraisal was required. I was asked to verify that payment information previously provided was accurate and could be used to process payment for the appraisal. The loan officer indicated that I would receive a lender 's credit for the appraisal amount at closing. I was charged {$440.00} for the appraisal, which was paid. 
I was given no opportunity to shop for an appraisal service. I was told this service was required by the lender. Under 12 CFR 1026.19 ( e ) ( 3 ), this makes the appraisal cost an item subject to zero tolerance. 
I never received a revised Loan Estimate detailing the change in the costs of my loan, as required by 12 CFR 1026.19 ( e ) ( 3 ) ( iv ). After the third business day following the date that Homeward was aware of the change ( XXXX XXXX, 2016 ), Homeward should have lost the ability to charge me for the increase in cost represented by the cost of the appraisal. Homeward should be required to rebate this cost under 12 CFR 1026.19 ( f ) ( 2 ) ( v ). 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received an initial Closing Disclosure ( CD ). A copy is attached. The initial CD included a charge for the appraisal of {$440.00}, shown as paid prior to closing. This CD included a lender credit of {$620.00}. Presumably, this amount was the original general lender credit disclosed on the Loan Estimate of {$180.00} plus the amount of the appraisal ( {$440.00} ). 
The loan was closed on XXXX XXXX, 2016. We received a copy of the final Closing Disclosure, which is attached. The CD did not include a rebate for the zero tolerance error related to the appraisal as required under 12 CFR 1026.38 ( h ). I received no lender credit of {$620.00}, as disclosed on the original Closing Disclosure. 
I contacted Homeward Residential on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to discuss this situation. I was told that I was not entitled to a rebate of the appraisal fee or any other costs associated with this loan. At that point, O notified Homeward of my intention to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
Under Regulation Z, I am entitled to a rebate of {$620.00} for the increased zero tolerance costs on my loan with no proper disclosure under the requirements of 12 CFR 1026.19 ( e ) ( 3 ) and 1026.19 ( f ) ( 2 ) ( v ). However, Homeward is refusing to rebate these funds."

217200,Student loan,"ACS Education Services manages one of my student loans. The loan originated with a balance of {$11000.00}. Per the ACS website, my payments began on XX/XX/XXXX. Over the course of the past 57 payments their website shows that they have applied {$5000.00} to principal. This would leave me with a balance of {$6000.00}. However, they show that my current balance is {$9000.00}. I have two complaints against ACS. The first being that they are using fraudulent accounting practices resulting in a substantially higher account balance than it should be. Secondly, I substantially increased the size of my payments for 10 months with the instruction that the additional amount should be applied to principal. Instead of applying the additional money to the principal they have applied it to future payments. They are now showing I am paid up through XX/XX/XXXX. My attempts to get them to correct this misapplication of the payment has been unsuccessful. They told me that I need to call them the day the payment is received. If I 'm too early they wo n't be able to see the payment and ca n't help me. If I 'm too late and the payment is already posted then it will be applied to future payments and they wo n't correct it.

In XXXX I spoke with a Wells Fargo representative and was told if I made a payment right then, it would keep my loans out of default and then when my classes started in XXXX my loans would again go into deferment. So I made the payment they required to keep my loans out of default. I started school in XXXX and asked my college to send verification to Wells Fargo, as I was instructed to do by the Wells Fargo Representative. 

My college 's policy ( XXXX XXXX ), is to only verify enrollment after the class drop date is passed, which is 4 weeks into the semester. Wells Fargo did try to verify my enrollment - but it was before the school will provide verification. This week I received notification that my loan is in default, and Wells Fargo also reported this to all XXXX credit bureaus, which in turn lowered my credit score from XXXX to XXXX. I have worked hard to maintain a great credit rating by always paying all my bills on time. 

After receiving notification I have spoken to several Wells Fargo representatives and explained my College 's policy and requested they verify it now as the 4 weeks has passed. 
They told me there is nothing they can or will do and are proceeding with the defaults. There is no way I can currently begin paying back these loans. I followed what Wells Fargo told me to do and they still continue to process a default. My college has now provided verification of my attendance to Wells Fargo and yet they still refuse to remove the default and restore my credit rating. 

it is unjust for Wells Fargo Bank to tell me how to resolve this situation and then after I follow exactly what they instructed me to do, they do n't do what they promised to do and instead force me into default ruining my financial future."

Luckily I do not have problem in making the making the loan payment but I would like to take advantage of a lower rate as available for ordinary consumers.
90382,Credit card,Capital one has been charging interest for years for cash advances that have not occurred. I have ask them to take these off many times but they refuse to do this. Their answer is that I took an advance out in XXXX which my statements show are not true. I have been unable to work this out with them. When on the phone they put me on hold for XXXX minutes with no final conclusion. Their responses are rehearsed and it is clear to me that I am not speaking to anyone who can rectify this. I have all staements from XXXX that I can send to an e-mail address.
520648,Bank account or service,"I opened an Extra20 account with Santander XX/XX/XXXX, soon after they started promoting it XX/XX/XXXX. I diligently met the requirements for approximately two years, earning $ XXXX monthly bonuses. However, the account type was discontinued and they switched me to another account type without ongoing bonuses. Original marketing materials contained the bonus amounts going up to five years. I believe the bank never intended to continue this type of account. They used it to attract new customers, giving a false sense of security with marketing materials showing five years of bonuses. They probably never intended to continue the account type, and hoped that customers would stay with them due to inertia. I consider this to be unethical and potentially abusive."
443851,Debt collection,The debt collector called me at my place of employment. I notifyed them I can not take such calls at work and provided a cell phone number. I called back on my cell phone and notifyed them that there is no debt to be paid because the medical bills were paid by insurance.

However I kept a receipt from their receiving center ( XXXX contracted XXXX to receive equipment on their behalf ) where the equipment was delivered. They also can not provide a detailed bill stating why it is {$1200.00}. Most of which I am sure were not authorized by myself. Charging me for services that I did not authorize does n't make sense nor is right.

I recently disputed this account with Equifax, and the information was reported as verified and accurate.

I felt i made small purchases and my account should not have went over. they also tried to sign me up for some hard ship program and later close the account with out me knowing or keeping it open. That the product i purchase on my card was not allowed to be returned to the card. they need to check and make sure the items that they are selling are really from their store.

521212,Mortgage,"Servicer : Nationstar MortgageBank : XXXXAfter suffering financial hardship and illness in our family we applied for and were granted a modification. Unfortunately the new modified payment was almost exactly the same due to the limited terms our lender would accept. We felt we had no other options at the time so we agreed to the modification. With the payments still the same it was only short time that we were struggling again. We started the process of applying for another modification in XXXX of 2014 as we were told that our lender would have more options available. For the past year we have been in this circle of applications and them having us do things over. Finally in the spring we were apparently denied due to a net present value ( NPV ), the problem is they never sent us the denial letter. When had to have them send us the letter which was almost a month after they said the initial denial letter was sent. This letter said we could have an appraisal done on our house at our expense ( {$500.00} ) but it had to be within 30 days of the letter. We had the appraisal done but it was after the 30 days due to us never receiving the original denial letter. You have the right to appeal and so we did, we provided everything they asked for. Then they continued to prolong the process, they wanted a new P & L, then they would want different dates on the P & L, then they wanted us to sign the P & L, never did they provide specific instructions. While we were in the process we provided everything they requested immediately, they request that you upload documents on their website and then sometimes they would take a week to post them. All this time on our online account it was showing they had what they needed and then two hours later they would want updated paystubs etc. The same day I spoke to our designated contact XXXX who stated they had everything I returned home to find sale dates posted on our house. There was no communication to us that they were going to precede with a trustee 's sale to give us notice or a chance to find other options. All we were asking for is to work with us on different options. If we had been informed that we were not eligible to apply for another modification we would have taken steps in the very beginning to sell our home. We are in underwriting right now regarding the modification so how is it okay for them to push the sale date at the same time. They have made this process impossible and prolonged the situation to a point that we are in a much worse position than when we started. We have worked hard to get to a better financial position and we have paid nearly {$500000.00} towards our house with very little to show for it. All we have asked is to have the chance to sell the house if we are not eligible for any help and keep the little bit of equity we have to move on with our lives. If we knew that we had to sell we would have used money from our 401K to get caught up and at lease sell the home.

The rep refused since I had been past due on my account. I discontinued call then on XXXX/XXXX/15 I spoke with a rep who refused to do the same. I said something off subject not offensive or rude or containing fowl language. He advised that we should conduct this phone call in a mature manner. I replied then hung up. i called back to ask for a manager and got XXXX employee id XXXX. She refused to allow me a manager XXXX in total. This is after advising her of my concern and request to waive late charges. She declined the request also. I advised at that time they no longer had permission to contact me on XXXX since it is a cell phone and they use an autodialer. She refused to remove the number based on the fact that satisfactory arrangements had not been made and my refusal to provide her with another number. I do n't have a non-cell phone number to provide her with since I ca n't have calls at work. My spouse is about to be laid off ... this is undue stress over XXXX dollars. She refused a supervisor stating that she was an account manager misrepresenting her position level. I advised the employee XXXX that is a title for a glorified CSR AND that I knew the law and fully intended to include all in a CFPB complaint. She advised that I would still get manual calls to my phone so I provided her with the number of XXXX since she continued to refuse to remove my number. I advised that it is a punishable fine or them to continue to call to which she continued to reply that no .. refusal to remove and so on. Please investigate this claim. This is ridiculous and these employees are misrepresenting themselves as managers and refusing manager or supervisor. In addition to refusal to remove my telephone number from their system which in fact a cell phone.

I called them to the number they provide on their collection letter, and they have pleanty of my information ( Full name, address & phone Number ). 
They also claim that they purchased the debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX!!! 
How is that possible? 

I called XXXX on XXXX XXXX to take care of this matter & they NEVER mentioned this company. 

EOS CCA has almost the same account number that the one that XXXX XXXX XXXX & the other company had, but it differs from only XXXX digits. 

Also, when I called EOS CCA to get an email with docs proving of the debt I owed he said that they do not email. But he said that he could send me another letter that would like exactly like the one I just got from them. 

When I was disputing my debt with the other collection company, they quickly emailed me docs to prove what I owed and how we could fix such. 

As a conclusion, EOS CCA is either a scam company trying to get money from people that is struggling with collections. Or a poorly run company that does not check facts on the people they are trying to collect money from."

13352,Consumer Loan,"Hello, I contacted you last year about Maxium Title Loans harrasing me over a unpaid loan. The case number that I was given XXXX. 

We eventually went to court on this matter and the judge ordered that I would have to pay {$730.00}, which what was owed when I defaulted on the loan after paying almost a year on it. 

I was going to have my wages garnished. The judgement came on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I received a call at work on XXXX XXXX, XXXX from somebody probing my coworkers for information. I had already left for the day and my coworker referred them to my human resource department, XXXX. There was also a voicemail left on my work number as well saying to give them a call. Within 30mins of my coworker calling me about the call they got, I received a phone call on my personal number. My number is not associated w/my name and can only assume that my HR department gave them my personal number. 

The number Maxium Title Loans called from was XXXX XXXX XXXX and the gentlemen said that they were going to move forward on garnishment and did I want to work something out. I was in shock that they were calling me after being instructed never to call me at work and they could have not have had my personal number without getting it from my employer somehow. All that information was in the first complaint. 

I told the gentlemen that we were in court almost a year ago and I have been waiting for the garnishment since the court date. The gentlemen said that I owed the company over {$1300.00}. I told him that my paperwork said that I owed {$730.00} and it 's not my fault that they waited almost 1 year to get an extra {$600.00} on interest. NOT FAIR!! I told the gentlemen to do what he needed to do because I was not working anything out with him or his company. The garnishment should have taken place immediately after our court date and not 1 year later to gain interest. I am also reaching out to the courts where the judgement came from to see if I can get back into court for this delay that will cost me {$600.00} ( case number XXXX XXXX )."
633592,Consumer Loan,I had a XXXX from Drive Time that turned out to be a lemon. They agreed to take it back and I could get another car. I got a XXXX which is now a mess also. The car has a short somewhere as it keeps locking its self and now the alarm keeps going off and I tried to undue the battery and kept it off for a while and when I put it back on alarm goes off again and I ca n't get in my truck cause it thinks the car is being broke into with the alarm going off. I was driving down the road one day when my lights started flickering and the alarm was going off while I was driving it. I was told XXXX was made better now and that they did n't have very many problems and now this which is now a second lemon plus the trunk pop up twice while I was driving it due to some damage back there that I did not see when purchased. They are selling cars that can cause wreaks or kill someone. I only had this car for 6 months.
587237,Bank account or service,I had a checking account with navy federal credit union that offered overdrafrt protection that i unfortunately took advantage of & got so far behind that i had a hard time paying back. Not fully understanding the terms or programs offered by the credit union i was under the impression that i needed to pay the overdrawn amount in full. My checking account was closed and sent for collection at the same time my savings account remained active. I had a significant amount of money deposited in my savings account when i tried to withdraw the money from my savings i was informed by the representatives from navy federal that i would have to set up arrangements to pay the amount overdrawn from my checking account before i would be able to access my savings account once i then spoke with the representative from that department she informed me ( very rudely ) that the credit union would be taking all the money from my savings account and that since she could not confirm my employment or source of income that i would n't be able to set up any arrangements & any future money deposited into my savings would be applied to my remaining overdrawn balance all this after explaining to her that i am a XXXX veteran living on a fixed income. I would think that navy federal credit union is supposed to offer benefits for XXXX and XXXX veterans instead of a rude & hostile customer experience i also again agreed to set up arrangements & while speaking with the agent she took all the money from my savings account. Any help with this will be greatly appreciated. I intend to pay off the remaining balance and close all my accounts and i will no longer do any business with navy federal credit union & anyone i speak with or know i would suggest the same.
459083,Mortgage,"This this is not a duplicate of CFPB Case number : XXXX as it is a new and separate incident. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after the issuance of the XX/XX/XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX installment statement and immediately prior to the Trustee Sale of XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America bought down the principal balance associated with this account twice, meaning it was bought down XX/XX/XXXX and put back after I called Bank of America on this illegal activity related to a mortgage or Deed of Trust and then bought down again XX/XX/XXXX. 

According to the information and representations provided to me on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX ( Customer Service Department ) and XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX ( Home Retention Department ) Bank of America employees, the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX installment payment amount is {$1100.00}, reduced from {$1500.00}. I was also informed the adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) will adjust between {$1100.00} and {$1200.00} effective XX/XX/XXXX which is supported by information received from the Trustee, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), that the MAXIMUM bid at Trustee 's Sale and public auction has been reduced to {$300000.00}. Obviously, this amount excludes the MHA and CalHFA monies due at time of sale. To date, neither the MHA and CalHFA debts have been satisfied and are currently attached to the account. 

This account is a signature loan as established XX/XX/XXXX and the associated real proprty had not been used as collateral to secure the XX/XX/XXXX Deed of Trust that Bank of America has foreclosed upon after a seven ( 7 ) year delinquency and after a rejected settlement offer made a year before recording a Notice of Default ( NOD ). Clearly, the Notice of Trustee Sale ( NTS ) ( which I have yet to receive a recorded copy of ) is a retaliatory action related to a mortgage or Deed of Trust. 

All previously mentioned resolutions are desired and mandatory."

457727,Credit reporting,"I am a U.S. citizen living in XXXX, and as part of a XXXX credit card I maintain ( I closed most of my accounts when moving out of the country, which was likely not a good idea as it might have affected my credit score ) I am able to get a summary report and credit score. I did that about two weeks ago, and realized that ( a ) the score is wildly inaccurate ( I recognize that is not the credit bureau 's part of the problem ) ; and ( b ) there is inaccurate information on the report, suggesting that I am not paying credit cards on time, which is not true. Indeed, it looks as if someone else may have opened a card in my name, since something like XXXX instances of a card paid late are apparently on the report, and I pay my XXXX credit card on time and indeed automatically! 
The real problem is that there is no way to use any of the XXXX credit bureau 's on-line systems without a U.S. address, nor is it possible to use the federal system that 's been set up by the CFPB without a U.S. address ( thank you for setting that up! ), nor is it possible to speak to a live person at any of the XXXX credit bureaus, at least I certainly could n't figure out how to. I sent a letter two weeks ago to Experian, with all details, since Experian had been listed as the source of the inaccurate information. I have yet to hear back, but I have n't given up hope. 
There are XXXX U.S. citizens living abroad ; we pay U.S. taxes ; and yet as far as I know we have no representation in Congress -- so no constituent services people to help. This situation with the credit reports needs to be addressed, since at this point I do n't know if I am a victim of fraud, and I could n't put a fraud alert on my accounts -- without a U.S. address! I 'm certain there are security concerns for sending reports out of the country, but there must be a good way to address that concern without making it impossible for U.S. citizens/taxpayers living abroad to get access to these important records. 

Thank you very much!"

They refused and I placed a dispute on my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I pulled a credit report showing late payments XX/XX/XXXX for 30 days XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX and 60 days XX/XX/XXXX. In an effort to refinance this loan in XX/XX/XXXX, the lender required me to remove the dispute from the CitiMortgage. It was then discovered that CitiMortgage was now showing late payments XX/XX/XXXX for 30 days XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and 60 days XX/XX/XXXX. As aresult of this misrepresentation, my credit score dropped by as much as XXXX points on XXXX of the bureaus.

Before the lawsuit, they would call me at all hours of the day, leaving horrible messages and the few times I spoke to them, they left me in a state of panic. I explained the current circumstances at the time and how I could pay but they would not accept it, they wanted all the money at one time and immediately. Communication with them was absolutely terrifying and I was afraid to even answer the phone. 

Hameroff sued me, I went to the courthouse but it would cost me additional money to answer, money I did not have. I left messages to the company but they did not return my calls. 

I began working with XXXX to help restructure my debt and even they had a difficult time establishing any kind of worthwhile communication. Hammeroff, treated them the same way they were treating me. 

Eventually, they got a judgment against me and garnished my wages for close to {$300.00} dollars every two weeks - that is the equivalent of half my paycheck. 

The debt could have been paid in one payment, but rather, they penalized me with close to {$1200.00} in fees for a debt that was less than {$300.00} dollars. 

Hameroff Law Firm, made it impossible for me to reply in court, make arrangements for payment or work with me - rather it was abusive phone calls, threats and harassment. 

Thank you."

Now they are not only reporting inaccurate delinquencies on those XXXX accounts but they are reporting incomplete information because they have removed 2 years worth of positive payment history on this account. They have also added the following to each account : Your Statement : Account previously in dispute - investigation complete, reported by data furnisher. This is in fact not my statement and I do not want it on either of these accounts because it is being portrayed as my statement which is both misleading and outright false.

I received a call from the company fours days later asking me for payment which I paid the same day. I was then charged fees for making the mistake and my online bill pay service is now suspended. My questions are why would a company need to verify a customers payment source that has not changed in over a decade, why would they need to do it when I 'm under pressure to get the payment in on time and if I wanted to change the payment source would n't that be up to me to do before trying to make a payment?

They also continue to ignore my request to provide a full accounting of merchandise ordered. The only thing I receive is an invoice with an amount due. I am already in a class action suit for XXXX 's poor collection practices. I believe the continued barrage of calls and letters is because any settlement monies I receive, XXXX go to amounts XXXX claims I owe, which I dispute. I work for a law firm, so the continued letters and calls caused an issue with my employer. After continued requests to remove the amount billed for the unreceived merchandise, I am now receiving a barrage of letters to my home, and still no response to my dispute or any offer to settle the matter I have also attempted to resolve direct with XXXX, who refers me back to XXXX XXXX.

I have been instructed by many of your Chrysler associates to "" contact an attorney or get a court order for the information I am requesting ''.

My attorney asked me to make one more attempt to resolve this directly with Chrysler Capital and XXXX XXXX. This letter serves as my final attempt to resolve this with you before taking formal legal action. 


II was told by one of your associates that XXXX XXXX made changes to the contract without my knowledge which again is illegal. When I asked for documentation, I was told that it was in the transcripts ( which again as a co-signer I am legally entitled to ). When I asked for said copy of transcripts in which they were referring to, I was again told that I would need to secure a court order to obtain. 


My attorney questioned "" who is actually under contract and its validity ''. The documents that I signed indicate that I am the co-signer. The extended warranty purchased is signed by XXXX XXXX. 


It is unclear to me how I could have been the co-signer and more over the buyer. I am currently unemployed and was not employed at the time the car was purchased I had no money in any bank account ; nothing to support the purchase of a new car. It appears as if the sale of a car outweighed basic loan approval principals that would clearly indicate that I would be unable to pay for said vehicle. 


I have requested previously and am doing so again via this written demand, copies of all documents related to the contract, loan work up sheets, credit report, loan approval, loan assignments, contracts etc. XXXX XXXX states that they did not have all the documents required by law in their files.

132957,Mortgage,"I purchased a home in XXXX, XXXX immediately after my divorce in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I had to relocate to XXXX, XXXX for my job so I rented the house and subsequently went through a nightmare situation with the renter, who did n't pay me for a while and finally did leave. I then put the house on the market and several months after, realized that any offer I would be able to obtain would require me showing up to the closing table with several thousand dollars that I did not have. So I started into the short sale process with US Bank, Account number XXXX, property address XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. After several months I finally received approval from them, and we began to collect offers. We went though several iterations of getting an offer, beginning the negotiation process with US Bank, the entire process taking so long that the buyers would walk away. Even one buyer invested money in fixing the house up so that it was pass inspection for his lender, but we could never get a response on the offer from US Bank. So the buyer walked away, we found another buyer, then US Bank would say my paperwork had expired and I had to reapply. So I would do that, several months later get approved again, obtain another buyer, only to have it fall through because of no response from US BANK. At this point we are approaching three years since I began the short sale process with US Bank. The home has been sitting empty and is nearly falling in at this point. I live hours away and can not maintain it. The most recent offer came XX/XX/XXXX and was for XXXX, the bank had stated the offer needed to be at least XXXX for it to work. Months after submitting the offer, the bank told me the paperwork had expired and I had to reapply for short sale approval. I did this and only a few months ago got approved, the buyer was still interested. So we started moving along and then my representative quit US Bank, the last email she sent was saying that everything was approved, and we were just awaiting approval letter. Now they are telling me it is n't even approved, even though I have an email from this person saying it was. My house has declined in value so much at this point I do n't know I can ever get another buyer. I have been threatened with foreclosure multiple times even though I 'm doing everything for short sale. My understanding is that other people in this situation are able to get through the short sale process in about a year, and I 'm approaching three. I qualify for this program due to relocation for my job, so I 'm not sure why US Bank is treating me this way. The damage that has been done to my credit is something you ca n't imagine, I could n't get credit for anything at this point. Even my car insurance rate is through the roof, I have no access to any credit in case of an emergency, and when I had to trade cars last year I was nearly declined even for that. I now pay more than anywhere near fair market rate because of this situation. XXXX XXXX. I really hate filing this but honestly do n't know what else to do.. plenty of other people have been able to sell their house via short sale, I 'm not sure why not me."
489971,Bank account or service,"I am a Wells Fargo customer, and have been for about 9 years. Wells has been charging me excessive overdraft fees for years. They will hold my and my wife 's direct deposit and run debts through first, so they can charge me fees. They say that this is their policy.They will also manipulate debt card transactions so that those will go through first, then they will process a electronic draft, like a car payment, that is pending, to bring my account balance down. They will also post a draft as pending then take it completely off, then they will bring it back showing pending a day later. So that they can charge more fees."
703421,Bank account or service,"In XXXX of XXXX, I opened a Health Savings Account ( HSA ) with Bank of America at the following website : myhealth.bankofamerica.com At no time during the set up of this account was any information regarding fees directly presented to me. Shortly after setting up this account, I received a debit card and and two pamphlets in the mail. The first pamphlet was an agreement pertaining to the debit card. 

The second pamphlet was entitled "" Bank of America Health Savings Account Custodial Agreement. '' On page XXXX of this agreement is a section entitled "" Article VI. Fees ''. The first sentence reads "" You agree to pay the applicable fees as set forth in the enclosed Schedule of Fees ''. At this point, I would like to emphasize that there was NO SCHEDULE OF FEES ENCLOSED, only the two pamphlets and a cover letter. 

Once my checking account had been linked to this HSA account. I made a contribution of {$1000.00}. I did n't log back in to this account until XXXX of this year ( XXXX ). From the time that I opened the account until the time I logged back in ( over four months ), I DID NOT receive any correspondence from Bank of America. I did not receive any emails from them letting me know that a quarterly statement was ready for viewing online. 

After logging in to make another contribution, I noticed that my initial {$1000.00} contribution had been reduced to {$980.00}, and I was outraged to say the least. Bank of America is using deceptive tactics on their website that is nothing short of criminal. I feel like I was robbed and violated on a continuous basis for the several months the account was open. I immediately closed the account and rolled the remaining money into a much more consumer-friendly institution -- XXXX. The final amount I got back from Bank of America was {$960.00} -- a disgusting amount from a disgusting company. 

Because I was NEVER directly shown any schedule of fees, either online or in the information sent to me in the mail ( which informed me that it was enclosed ), AND because they never informed me by email that a quarterly statement had been prepared, I feel that all fees should be returned to me. Had I seen the quarterly statement they prepared in XXXX, I would have promptly closed the account. 

I should note that the schedule of fees is "" available '' online, but you have to dig to find it. AND It is NEVER presented to you in a clear and fair way while setting up the account. I would also like to point out that their Custodial Agreement does say that I would be notified when statements are ready -- this never happened. 

It really is shameful, and I am surprised that these tactics are legal. It 's as if I bought a car, but the dealer never told me how much it was and secretly withdrew whatever he wanted from my bank account every month -- forever. 

Thank you for your time, and I would appreciate any help with this matter. It 's not a lot of money, it 's the principle ( no pun intended ) of the matter, and I do n't want this to happen to anyone else."

615222,Bank account or service,Huntington Bank took over XXXX dollars from my accounts and left me with a XXXX balance with no warning or notification. The representatives were very rude in informing me that the money was taken for an offset from the previous year. This left me in a very precarious situation as I was unable to maintain costs for work and home.
253240,Credit card,"Dear Sir/Ma'am I am writing in regards to my Menards ' Big Card. I paid my minimum balance on XXXX/XXXX/16 of {$110.00} and an additional {$1000.00}. I wrote on my check that I wanted the extra to go against the 6 month higher interest rate charge. 
At that time I had the following charges - XXXX - 48 month 3.99 financing - {$2900.00} - XXXX 6 month same as cash accruing 25.24 % - {$1400.00} So I figured that the extra {$1000.00} would go against the XXXX When I look at my XX/XX/XXXX statement. I see that all but {$44.00} went against the 48 month 3.99 % financing. The {$44.00} was the minimum payment due. 
Again I made a payment at the store for {$1500.00} and {$350.00} on XXXX/XXXX/16. Again I asked for the extra to be applied to the 6 month free financing. 
When I look at my XX/XX/XXXX statement, it shows that all of this was applied to the minimum balances due and to the reduced 48 month financing. 
I would like this fixed so that I am not charged an exorbitant amount of interest in 3 and 4 months ' time when the promotional expiration date is completed. 
I would like the minimum payment due applied as specified in the statement and then I would like the extra {$1000.00} from XXXX XXXX, 2016 - removed from the txn XXXX ( 48 months free ) - and applied against txn XXXX ( 6 months same as cash accruing 25.24 % ) So their balance as of the XX/XX/XXXX statement would be - $ XXXX = {$2800.00} + 6.39 Interest = & gt ; {$2800.00} - $ XXXX {$420.00} With a new transaction - XXXX - 6 month same as cash accruing 25.24 % {$710.00} ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ) On my XX/XX/XXXX I get a PROMOTION Expiration ALERT!! Saying that the transaction that I thought would be paid off. Has n't been paid off at all and there is {$68.00} of deferred interest. I was paying off the promotional payoff. 
I had made two more payments on XX/XX/XXXX of {$1800.00} to pay the minimum balance and pay against the transactions - XXXX = $ XXXX-XXXX ( minimum ) = {$380.00} - XXXX = $ XXXX-XXXX ( minimum ) = {$690.00} - XXXX = $ XXXX-XXXX = {$2800.00} Leaving {$1700.00} left to pay off the 6 months same as cash and start on the 48 months low rate Should have balances of - XXXX = {$380.00} - XXXX = XXXX - XXXX = {$690.00} - XXXX =XXXX - XXXX = {$2800.00} - XXXX = {$2100.00} + the accrued interest With my new transactions - XXXX ( 48 month 3.99 % financing ) {$1500.00} - XXXX {$310.00} Return - XXXX of {$200.00} against txn XXXX So I should have the following transactions left to pay off - XXXX ( 48 months 3.99 % from XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) - XXXX ( 48 months 3.99 % from XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) - XXXX ( from XXXX/XXXX/2016 at 25.24 % ) I am not exactly sure how much these each should be because of the return and the different interest that was n't added on because of how the different transactions were cleared off. 
I would like the following {$200.00} to be paid against the minimum due against transactions - XXXX ( 48 months 3.99 % from XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) - XXXX ( 48 months 3.99 % from XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) - XXXX ( from XXXX/XXXX/2016 at 25.24 % ) And the remainder paid against - XXXX ( from XXXX/XXXX/2016 at 25.24 % ). 
By law the highest percent interest transaction should be paid off first with any moneys left over after the minimum amount due is applied. 25.24 % accruing interest is much higher than 3.99 %."

The banking rep stated that we would have access to most of the money. They would hold {$1500.00} while the check cleared. This seemed normal and we deposited the check.

We submitted a request for a short sale, with the Home Financial Hardship Application and all required paperwork, to US Bank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. In early XXXX, we received letters that XXXX relationship managers, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, have been assigned to our case. Since then we have cumulatively left XXXX voicemail messages and sent XXXX emails to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, but received not a single response. We have also repeatedly called the US Bank customer service lines for both mortgages and home equities, but were given the run-around each and every time. 

We recently received an offer on our property which was below the value of our debt, but not having received authorization for a short sale we were unable to accept the offer. 

We are XXXX XXXX XXXX seniors with serious health issues ( please see attached HFHA hardship letter ). It is now 74 days since we submitted our request. We need assistance and are extremely frustrated and disappointed by the way US Bank has handled our case. We respectively request the CFPB 's assistance to resolve our case in an expeditious manner.

536788,Mortgage,"Case # XXXX. I wish to give an example of how Wells Fargo lies and also to serve as an example to Wells Fargo if this case needs to go to Federal Court what it is they can expect. On the envelope I received from Wells Fargo on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX there is a section investigated by XXXX XXXX, in which she gives a conclusion of the investigation on the matter. First I quote from page XXXX. "" On XXXX XXXX, XXXX you authorized a phone payment to draft on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, in the amount of {$810.00} which was applied to the XXXX XXXX payment. Upon completion of the phone payment, you were provided with the confirmation number of XXXX. 

This payment was returned not honored by your financial institution and was reversed from the mortgage loan on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, causing your loan to be due for the XXXX XXXX, XXXX payment. A confirmation number is provided when a payment by phone is completed however it does not guarantee funds from your financial institution. As of the date of this letter, your loan is due for the XXXX XXXX, XXXX, payment in the amount of {$810.00}. '' I asked for this to be investigated as Wells Fargo destroyed things with their lies. 

Wells Fargo was proud of its thorough investigation. But now I will give the truth of the Matter. You will see a difference on the truth vs the lies. 
I have a statement dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I paid XXXX to catch up to my mortgage. In that statement the payment for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was included. I did not notice that at first until Wells Fargo informed me of it. When I received my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX billing statement I sent the payment of {$810.00}. Which means I paid the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX payment XXXX. It was not I who called Wells Fargo on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, it was Wells Fargo who called me. I was told that because of the over payment I made I did not owe for the month of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and because I had also overpaid almost XXXX my payment for XXXX would be less. I was given a confirmation number in which Wells Fargo in XXXX of their tricks changed the information on it. I had asked my son XXXX XXXX XXXX to talk to Wells Fargo to see if I understood them correctly, that I owed no payment for XXXX XXXX and only a partial payment for XXXX XXXX. The information was confirmed. As for for their lie that I gave approval for a payment to be withdrawn from my account. I was previously told that no automatic payments could be taken from my account as the filing of the Bankruptcy "" killed it ''. I was told I could redo the electronic debit for my payments at a later date. Wells Fargo went ahead and tried to take the payment that was already paid out of my Checking account XXXX different times. This caused me to be overdrawn on my account twice and I was charged over the limit fee. I have proof of the double payment I made, one is the statement sent by Wells Fargo and the other is the payment I paid by Check for the same month of XXXX. Wells Fargo refuses to accept that I paid double for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Wells Fargo owes me {$810.00} plus the late fees they charged and the interest I paid. Let these facts be proof of their lies. The proof of their other lies will be told to a future attorney. Wells Fargo, your lies with us are over!"

This is the height of deceptive advertising. The credit card company has no record of the people in their accounts opening department telling me I would receive the miles ( they say they do not record conversations! ).

I went to the local branch in XXXX OH to set up the account. We discussed the offer and the criteria but the offer would not work in the branch.

I call the your customer service line and was told I had to make a single direct deposit of {$500.00} to qualify. The information I received at the branch differed. I was told when discussing the criteria that I had to make direct deposits totaling {$500.00}. I made a {$250.00} direct deposit every paycheck, 2 weeks, over that 90 day time frame totaling {$1500.00}, meeting the criteria in my understanding. I was told, because the account was initiated in the branch, to speak with branch manager, and after that her boss, then it was escalated to the district manager and they all said I did n't qualify. The also stated that it because the account was opened online they could n't help. Both departments blamed each other and pitched me between the two. No other solutions were offered. I acted on the information I was given in person at the branch. Had I had the correct information I would have deposited the {$500.00} as a single deposit.

It might be a possibility that someone purposely removed my {$2100.00} check from the Chase ATM XXXX since XXXX/XXXX/2016. That would be criminal and Chase Bank should track down that person who is responsible for this incident. The Computer System in the ATM should be able to create/generate logs from the deposit since I made the deposit around XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2016. The ATM printed out a receipt after the ATM swallowed my {$2100.00} check without crediting {$2100.00} into my Chase bank account. As I witnessed, the ATM system was shutting down by itself after the receipt was printed, then I saw Window 7 Operating System Logo at the bottom of the ATM screen, then ATM rebooted itself. After the reboot was done, the message of "" The ATM has experienced a Technical Problem '' displayed again on the ATM Machine 's Screen. I called the Chase Claim department at XXXX ( shown on the receipt ) immediately to file a claim right away and spent some time to explain clearly what happened to my deposit failure with the Chase Claim Specialist, but I am uncertain if the Claim Specialist who answered the call the first time was responsible and wrote down or recorded what I reported to her in greater details to help the research and investigations. 

QUESTION : Who has the solid background that can work and solve this problem with a concrete resolution for this ATM Deposit Dispute at XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2016 that I made? It requires a team of very experienced Engineers to look at the ATM Computer logs and all video feeds to analyze, find the check, and know what had happened to the check that I deposited at XXXX XXXX EST on XXXX/XXXX/2016. This incident should be traceable as it ate my {$2100.00} check without crediting my Chase Bank Account, and the computer logs should be captured by the ATM computer system if the deposit is failed and I have a printed receipt to show. If not, I would really question the DESIGN of Chase ATM system that simply could not handle deposit failures like this. This is a failure of JPMorgan Chase ATM XXXX and JPMorgan Chase Bank , N.A . should take all the responsibilities and improve their ATM as soon as possible to prevent more Chase Customers from suffering losses ( both checks or cashes ). Do you build the reliable ATMs to allow customer to use it? Most of all, I need the {$2100.00} to be credited permanently from JPMorgan Chase Bank , N.A . and this matter can not take lightly."

American Financial Resources debits my escrow account for disbursements, such as the property tax bill, but the tax assessor does not actually receive the check payment until 25-30 days after when the disbursement was taken from my account, meaning AFR is floating the payments to their benefit. Most recently they disbursed my tax payment on XX/XX/2016 for a bill that was due on XX/XX/2016. I called AFR customer service and they stated the check had been mailed on XX/XX/2016, yet as of XX/XX/2016 the tax collector has not received it. This is creating a problem for me as I am refinancing with closing the week of XX/XX/2016. The new escrow agent is reporting the taxes as up-paid and requiring me to pay twice, even though I have shown them AFR claims the payment was made. AFR should not be allowed to float the escrow payments as is their practice."

640017,Money transfers,"( 1 ) I attempted to transfer funds from Citibank in XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I did so online, and I was assured in that online transaction that the funds would arrive on XXXX XXXX, using the XXXX feature. The aim was to replenish the Hawaii account before an overdraft. ( 2 ) Subsequently, Citibank neither sent email nor telephoned about the attempt. ( 3 ) I received mail from the Hawaii bank dated XXXX XXXX, I learned that the deposit had not occurred. ( 4 ) I then went online to access the history of my account, discovering that the transfer was classified as "" Cancelled. '' ( 5 ) I went online again on XXXX XXXX to make the same transfer, and was again assured that the amount would be transferred, this time by XXXX XXXX. ( 6 ) I telephoned Citibank to ask why and I was informed that I had not provided a verification code required to complete either transfer. ( 6 ) While still on the telephone, Citibank then walked me through a process to obtain a verification code for the XXXX XXXX transaction, but to obtain the code I was instructed to hang up, get the code, and enter the code on the website. ( 7 ) I hung up and found three messages saved on my telephone. When I listened to them, they all said that I would have to tap the 1 button on my telephone for the code. In all three cases, pressing the 1 button yielded nothing but a message to tap the 1 button. 
My complaint is ( a ) that while using XXXX, there was no requirement on the website to get a verification code as part of the process, ( b ) there was no Citibank notification, either by email, telephone, or online that the transaction was being held up for lack of a verification code, ( c ) that no verification code was even sent when I tried, ( d ) my XXXX account was not replenished, so I have been billed by that bank {$30.00} for the overdraft fee and {$3.00} daily ever since. 
Remedy : Citibank must pay the expenses incurred for failing to provide adequate information about how to make the transfer."

XXXX XXXX XXXX in collections explained that he would have to pull the credit report of both me and the co-signer in order to see if lower payments were possible. I explained that I wanted to address this on my own as I did not want to burden the co-signer with having their credit report pulled and them having to produce financial statements, etc. XXXX XXXX said then I have to pay the loan as is and reminded me that I am 10 days past due and demanded a time certain when the bill would be paid.

He continued his aggressive language and threatened me with more collection efforts. 
I am baffled that : 1 ) My loan is 10 days past due and I am being treated like a criminal by Navient 2 ) I am willing to pay, ask for a reduced payment amount and Navient is making it difficult. 
3 ) XXXX would take on such a aggressive demeanor when I called to find out about payment options for a bill that has not even gone 30 days past due.

615445,Mortgage,"It has been reported to the credit agencies by Citibank that we have missed mortgage payments and are delinquent. The reporting of this information by Citibank is an error and is false. As a victim XXXX we were told by Citibank that we were eligible for a forbearance on our mortgage payment. We were informed that the excused mortgage payments would be added onto the end of the loan. At the end of the forbearance, we started to make regular scheduled payments. Shortly thereafter, we received notification from Citibank that the entire balance for the months of the forbearance were due in full. When we called, we were told by Citibank that the information we received regarding the repayment of the forbearance amount was incorrect. Citibank stated that this was the result of inaccurate and misinformation being administered by customer service because of the unique situation regarding XXXX XXXX. Citibank further stated that in their effort to administer aid to XXXX victims as quickly as possible customer service was not fully knowledgeable of what procedures regarding forbearances were permitted. 

As a result, every mortgage payment we made was being applied to the payments due during the forbearance period thereby making our current payments appear late. We have been trying amicably to resolve this issue and have spoken to countless customer service reps, supervisors and have even written to the office of the President, to no avail. Even after sending us two separate letters stating that they would repair our credit, CitiMortgage has failed to rectify this matter. This has been going on since 2012 and our credit reports appear as if we have missed numerous payments. This is not possible because the forbearance was only for XXXX months and when it was over we started making payments and have continued to do so to date. As of XXXX 2014, Citibank sold our loan to XXXX and the misinformation and negative reporting has been continued by XXXX. We were with Citibank for close to XXXX years and never missed a mortgage payment."

I 'm very disappointed, frustrated and angry with this whole application process and do n't see any reason that I should have to pay yet another penalty to Chase when I have been in complete compliance with all of their requests, etc. 
I really believe that my loan application with Chase is being mishandled and that I 'm being fraudulently charged for penalties that are not due to my timely response to their requests but to Chase 's inability and even refusal to act within their own timeframes. 
I do n't know what else to do. I want this loan but I really feel that I 'm being ripped off here. I did agree, reluctantly to the first penalty. However, I just ca n't give Chase another almost {$1000.00} when they still have 3 days to finish my loan and are refusing to do so.

270188,Consumer Loan,"I would like to dispute the loan I took out with Prosper. I have been disputing this loan with them since I noticed they took out a XXXX % origination fee when I received my loan in XX/XX/XXXX. I believe this loan was very misleading when I applied. I needed a loan in the amount of {$4200.00}. I was given Prosper 's information through a 3rd party and looked up the website. The website advertises how great they are with no hidden fees. I went through the process and was approved. Unfortunately, I did not realize they took out a 5 % origination fee because it was buried throughout the loan process. In reading reviews about Prosper, I have discovered there are other people who claim they were not aware of the processing fee as well. 

If you go through the Prosper loan process, they do not mention anything about their fees until you been approved for the loan, which is near the end of the process and easily missed, which unfortunately I did. 

I called Prosper on XXXX or XXXX/XXXX/16 when my husband noticed only {$3900.00} was deposited into our bank account on XXXX/XXXX/16, I asked about the origination fee and when I can pay the loan in full without any fees because I did not agree with the 5 % fee. The rep I spoke with gave me bad information and told me I can pay it back anytime without having to pay a fee. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I called multiple times and was even hung up on by someone claiming to be a manager. Prosper even admits they can see I called on XXXX or XXXX/XXXX/16 but say they do not have any notes on my call or what it was about. This seems to me that they do not take responsibility for their employees and they are not properly trained. I did finally speak to someone on XXXX/XXXX/16 who said they would investigate. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I was told they would not void the loan because they do not have record on my complaint until XXXX/XXXX/16. Even though, they acknowledge I have called before. 

Also according to Prosper, the loan was deposited into our account on XXXX/XXXX/16 and as our records indicate, it was shown on our end on XXXX/XXXX/16. They claim we did not address the problem in time even though I called as soon as my husband noticed we were shorted money. 

Every time I called Prosper to dispute the loan and return the money to them, they said they would not oblige because they claim the processing fees are explained as clear as day on their website but the very first thing you see on their website is NO HIDDEN FEES. I actually had to have someone from Prosper point it out to me where the origination fee was during one of my phone calls because I could not find it in my account myself. The bottom line is Prosper is claiming to be something they are not and I feel this loan was deceiving. 

The process was very confusing where I was led to believe there was not any fees charged but then they disclose their fees deep within the process that was not easy to find or understand. I have documents showing the loan process. My husband even started the process himself but stopped in the middle because he did not want to actually get a loan. He receives constant emails from them telling him to get his easy loan since he never completed the process. However, there is not any mention of any processing fees that Prosper claims are clearly stated. 

Please review the documents that I have provided and help me get this loan voided. Thank you for your time and consideration."

Person #XXXX advised me that I should wait for couple of more days and call back because the loan is new and probably did not get booked in their system yet. Then I asked how long does it usually take to book the loan - her response was XXXX days.  So I told her that there is no point for me to wait.  I need a confirmation that my loan was truly transferred and asked to speak her supervisor again. After putting me on hold, Person #XXXX  came back telling me that she spoke to her Supervisor and there is no point to transfer me to her as she will tell me the same thing - this time is to call XXXX and confirm whether or not my loan was transferred to them.  As I explained to Person #XXXX  - what if I received a letter from a fraudulent mortgage company claiming that they purchased my loan, of course, if I would call the same number on that letter, they would confirm. I need a confirmation from RSM that they transferred, before I make my payment and call my Hazard Insurance company requesting a change (every time I change, I get charged). What I explained to Person #XXXX is based on what she told me, RSM's Call Center has no idea where my loan is. I also advised her that I will filing this complaint today. The only reason why I believe that most likely XXXX is my new servicer and is not a fake company is because it was in the news recently, thanks to CFPB. 

I believe RSM owes me a disclosure informing me that the loan has been officially transferred for my documentation purposes."

They also were adamant that it was not the buyers fault for the delay. We checked back daily and were told the same thing. Then on XX/XX/2016 we received the denial of financing and cancellation from the buyer. The reason we were given was the buyer 's credit was poor.

96878,Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have a home equity line of credit second mortgage loan with Bank of America on our home. This loan ( XXXX ) originated on XX/XX/XXXX. The loan agreement expiration date is XXXX XXXX, XXXX and it comes with a ten year draw period. It is common practice for a performing line of credit for the bank to extend the draw period once the initial term expires. In my case, Bank of America chose to deny us the option to extend the draw period. Under the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, discrimination against credit applicants on the basis of race is prohibited. It is my claim that Bank of America is not in compliance with the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act. There has NOT be any material change in our financial circumstances, contrary to what Bank of America claims. When this loan commenced, we chose the interest only payment option because it allowed us the greatest flexibility with payment amounts on a monthly basis. The payment history reflects that although we chose the interest only payment option, we always made principal payments on a monthly basis. The value of our home is such that it is in compliance with the banks ' loan to value ratio. Once the draw period expired in XX/XX/XXXX, we requested a 10 year extension. This was denied by the bank. They informed us that we needed to amortize the loan balance over a specific term. The payment option Bank of America initially offered to us as significantly above our capacity to pay. We informed them that we could not comply with these new payment terms and they offered their RMA program, Request For Mortgage Assistance. Since XX/XX/XXXX, we 've completed multiple forms sent to us by the bank, During this time period, we 've continued to make the same loan payments we 've made during the past ten years, which is an amount above the interest only threshold. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that Bank of America has been reporting to the credit bureaus negative information regarding payments. It was my understanding that during this credit review period, that the payment terms would remain the same, particularly since I informed the Bank that we could not make there revised fully amortized payments. At that same time Bank of America is allegedly claiming to assist us with the line of credit, they are reporting negative information to the credit bureaus, thereby ruining my credit. Bank of America should be held accountable for this unfair action. They are the ones who have requested on XXXX different occasions over the past five months for additional credit information. We have provided this data on a timely basis while at the same time, paying on the line of credit. During this transition period of gathering financial information, you would think that Bank of America would allow the initial payment terms to apply until it could be determined what we could afford to pay. Bank of America is practicing unfair credit policies."

The fact that they report a XXXX balance to XXXX confirms that at least part of their records correctly reflect this settlement but obviously their records are still badly in error.

Portfolio continues to ignore my legitimate requests under federal law and knowingly and arrogantly reports erroneous information to my credit report in violation of the FCRA.

Suntrust had never said that I would need to cover any closing cost in fact they have always said those costs would be rolled into the refinance. With the banks closing at XXXX for the weekend there was no way to even get a check if I had wanted to. In addition to that the notary made mention that my wife would need to be at signing. I have n't been married for 12 years and in fact Suntrust had requested a copy of my divorce decree which I provided, two months prior.

366675,Mortgage,"We started a modification process with Nationstar Mortgage in XXXX of 2015. They informed us that we had to get approval and then we had to go through a trial period until they would complete the paperwork for the new modified payment. They did n't mention until much later that during our trial period we would report as late but as soon as the refinance went through, it would be zero ' d out as long as the trial period payments were made on time. It took over a month but finally we were approved for our trial payment. We made our trial payments on time. We still received collection calls during that time but after a few minutes trying to explain and argue with the agents the light bulb would go off and they would apologize for calling. We watched our credit score drop even further during this trial but just hoped that once the modification was complete, would bounce quickly. We have worked very hard to build up our credit after being victim to the mortgage crisis years ago. Finally 3 months were up. It took us trying to call several times to find out the next steps. Finally they said paperwork was being sent out. A week passed and we never received the paperwork so more calls were made. Finally someone called us back saying that the paperwork was mailed but that they would email it. A few days after we received the email, the overnight package with the paperwork arrived on our door with a postmark of a few days before. We scrounged up our witnesses and scheduled time we did n't have ( I had just given birth XXXX ) and went to a bank were they could notarize the paperwork. Paperwork was sent back through fax. We waited several weeks and attempted to make contact with Nationstar again. Several messages later, we finally received a callback and found out there was a document missing. Even though we refaxed it, something was still wrong with the paperwork and we had to start all over again. We took more time out, had witnesses take time out of their day and start the process over, that was XXXX XXXX. We fedex 'd the paperwork back to them, with the holidays and all the craziness of having newborn twins, time got away from us but I really thought our paperwork had gone through. In XXXX, we received notification that our modification was completed. Finally an end to this craziness ; I thought. The end of XXXX I review my credit report after receiving a letter that a line of credit was being cancelled due to new delinquency and it shows me 8 months past due with Nationstar, several were 120 days. I submitted a claim to dispute through the credit bureaus, which they fought. Again, we started the process of trying to contact a person from Nationstar. Once we were even hung up on because they were having system issues. Finally we got ahold of someone and was told that once again something was n't right with our paperwork and it had to be redone and that is why it was still reflecting so far past due ( even though I have continued to make my payments on time every month ). This is the only account showing delinquent on my credit report. I want all negative credit marks removed now and I do n't want any additional work from us to complete the modification on our mortgage. Because of this, I have been delayed on starting any process of selling my home to purchase XXXX closer to family to help out with my baby twins. I also recommend that Nationstar look into their contact procedures and how they can effectively keep customers updated with changes or needs from them. This has gone on long enough and our credit and time has been effected enough. Nationstar is in violation of FCRA and UDAAP regulations."
386296,Bank account or service,"! I was scammed out of {$8900.00} of my hard earned money, for a car that does n't even exist, and yet my bank refuses to call it "" fraud. '' They wo n't even file a fraud claim at this point. After several attempts to put in a claim for fraud, my bank still refuses to even consider the matter as nothing more than a consensual wire transfer, in which I knowingly gave all my money away to a crook. 

To make this domestic wire transfer ( which, to my understanding, was told that it was an escrow account ), I needed to include XXXX pieces of information for the outgoing wire transfer request. It was not an escrow account at all. Rather a means by which a scammer took away all of my money. On the wire transfer services form, I have the date, the name of the banker, my name and address, the name of the beneficiary, their account number, their address, their routing number, the beneficiary 's bank name, and bank address. I was actually inside a branch, on the phone with this person, while I was making the wire transfer. The thief on the other end, however, was at least kind enough to take {$30.00} off of the original price of the car ( {$9000.00} ), and put it toward the cost of the wire transfer ( {$30.00} ), itself, making the amount to be received by the beneficiary exactly {$8900.00}. 

So, on Tuesday, XXXX the XXXX, I made a domestic wire transfer from my bank ( Wells Fargo ) to a receiving bank ( XXXX ) in the amount {$8900.00} for a car that I was supposed to receive, from a seller with whom I made the transaction online. This car was a black 2013 XXXX XXXX XXXX featured on XXXX, under the XXXX section. I still have the link to the original posting ( http : XXXX ), which I will also be attaching with this email, as well as correspondence between myself and the seller. The original posting for this XXXX ad has since been flagged for removal, although I am not the one who flagged it. Needless to say, the car never arrived, of course, because it never existed in the first place. Within all of the documents I will be attaching are emails from the seller, in which they knowingly provide a false VIN number ( XXXX ), a fake XXXX report, request a dollar amount, and confirmation that they have received payment, as well as promise to ship the item between XXXX and XXXX on the XXXX of XXXX. 

I have contacted my bank as well as the beneficiary 's bank regarding this matter. The beneficiary bank, XXXX, seems to be taking this matter very seriously and appears to be eager to help resolve this matter. They currently have placed a hold on the beneficiary 's account, and have their resolution team investigating. Wells Fargo, however, my bank, will not even file a recall, or a fraud claim. They outright refuse. Banks do not have to play judge or jury in matters of transaction disputes, and Wells Fargo takes it as their right to do just that : IGNORE IT! Even after all the proof I have given them, including the fake VIN number ( which the seller knowingly provided ), they refuse to say that it was a matter of fraud. They are treating it as a matter of my word against the beneficiary 's, and nothing more. They could n't care less. After all, this did n't happen to the bank : it happened to me. Sure, banks spend XXXX on advertising, to present XXXX with a warm/fuzzy exterior. But in the end, what the banks ultimately see are numbers. It could well be that my bank sees that I am not worth much ; therefore, I am not on their priority list. Be that as it may, I believe that under Federal Banking Guidelines, ALL money is protected : even money that is obtained by deceit/fraud. And what my bank is doing is a blatant violation of Federal Banking Laws. The other bank wants to give me my money back : my bank does n't want to let them."

Message From : XXXX Subject : Secured Credit Line Date : XXXX XXXX, 2016 XXXX XXXX So even though I only asked for info on how to close the account ... you have gone ahead and just done it with no info ... and then claim it is at my request because obviously you can not read. And even worse ... I still have no information about getting my deposit back ... either wire the money today or re-open the account. I will be filing a complaint with the FTC. Your correspondence system is a symbol of incompetence. What a joke. I demand a call an apology today XXXX with a full explanation of this travesty of customer service.

From : XXXX Subject : Secured Credit Line Date : XXXX XXXX, 2016 XXXX XXXX XXXX, Thanks for the response. I guess the question I have now asked multiple times is this ... HOW DO I CLOSE MY ACCOUNT THEN!!! If I am not valuable enough to consider for a regular line of credit instead of a secured line, why should I stay with Citibank? I have unsecured offers from other banks. How do I go about closing the account and getting my deposit back? If my payment history thus far doesnt give me any status with you as a card provider ... why should I stay. Basically I am paying a fee to borrow my own money still. 

From : me***********************om Subject : Secured Credit Line Date : XXXX XXXX, 2016 XXXX XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX We appreciate the time you took to let us know that we did not meet your expectations. For this we sincerely apologize as your business is very important to us. 

Unfortunately, since your account is a Secured Credit card, we are unable to process a credit line increase or raise the limit set on your account. The credit line for your account is based on the amount of money you provided for the Certificate of Deposit when the account was opened and therefore can not be changed. 

Please know that we will continue to improve our service to you and we hope that you will continue to make Citi your choice for quality and value. 

If we can be of further assistance, please let us know.

700994,Credit card,I invited my son and his girl friend over to my house for XXXX. He stole 3 of my credit cards which I didnt know were missing. I received a bill from one card and knew it had to be him. I went to his house and demanded it back not knowing that he still had 2 other cards. On XXXX I got another bill and realized he still had my cards so I went and got them back and called the police and reported to them that he stole them. I called the credit card companies and canceled the cards. They said he had authorization because he is a relative.
734139,Mortgage,"We have been denied a modification with Citi Mortgage. The denial is not my complaint. This information is new and in addition to my previous complaint that was filed. My complaint is what we have expressed previously, along with new errors on their part that has put us in danger of losing our home. When we received the modification denial letter from Citi, it stated in one area that the information that they used in the decision making process was "" letter of agreement between responsible parties - letter between XXXX individuals stating the amount of child support ''. We have never received or paid out child support. We have been married for 39 years. Where are they getting their information from. I want them to provide that letter. Another item in the letter is our "" monthly gross income of all borrowers on your loan before payroll deductions or taxes '', they have listed {$8300.00}, which amounts to {$100000.00}. We have never made that amount. It is about {$20000.00} more than what we actually receive. I ask that they prove where these figures came from. We put trust in Citi that they have responsible, educated individuals going through this process for their customers. Obviously they do not. What a shame, they are messing with individual livelihood. 
XXXX XXXX gave false information to our third party representative XXXX XXXX. He told we had XXXX choices, either a short sale or we could do a re-payment plan. If we chose the repayment plan we would have to pay {$11000.00} down. XXXX ( our XXXX party representative ) had a phone appointment with XXXX XXXX on Thursday, XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX PST. He did not hold up to this meeting and never did make contact with XXXX for another meeting. XXXX contacted Citi to arrange another meeting, only to find out that our file was no longer with XXXX XXXX no longer had our case & was transferred to a different representative. Surprise, surprise another representative. I should not be surprised. This just delays us with finalizing this process. Add 's days to the finalization, adding additional interest at our cost. This is so wrong how they have dragged this process out. We are paying for their unprofessional operation. 
We always provided all requested documents in a timely manner through this entire lengthy process. Over and over because they kept changing our processors. It should be required that all documents are available for the next processor, without making the customer start over. 
Something needs to be done with the way Citi has handled our account. False information, not stopping a foreclosure date when requested because our file was not complete, when it was complete, unnecessary delays, not holding up to scheduled meeting. Telling us on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX they anticipate resolving our case within 15 days. Here it is XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and finally being resolved. This shows they do n't care or know what they are doing, 10 months later we are finally at the end of resolving this. 
We are behind on our payments because in order to "" pre-qualify '' for a modification we had to show a need. Being current is not showing a need. So were instructed to make the next 4 payments at half of what we would normally pay, Not knowing what I know now, that put us into a foreclosure status, which then did not allow us to make payments. Just because someone is current on their loan does not mean there is not a need for help. 
Citi needs to provide a copy of the letter in regards to child support and the documentation showing that our {$8300.00} as they have stated on the letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This is false inaccurate information. XXXX XXXX provided false information. XXXX XXXX provided false information. If a consumer presents false information to a bank, they are held accountable. Should this not go both ways?"
28458,Debt collection,They have called me back to back in the same day after me speaking with the rep named XXXX. I just talked to him at XXXX pm on XX/XX/2016 and he called me back on XX/XX/2016 at XXXX. He is harassing me and I advised him of that he still calls.
412728,Credit reporting,"After disputing the following debts with Equifax 2 times they have come back as saying verified but have shown no proof of how this debt was verified there are strict requirements how debt must be verified IAW the FCRA. They are required by FCRA to verify with the files they have on hand not by e-oscar or electronic coding. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) requires the Credit Bureaus ( Equifax, Experian & Transunion ) to have PHYSICAL COPIES in THEIR files of documentation to support each account being reported. NOT THE CREDITOR, THE BUREAU! 
Under the FCRA, Credit Reporting Agencies ( EQUIFAX ) must provide a copy of the verifiable original creditor documentation if it is requested properly by the consumer. Since Equifax can not provide phyproof of verification to me in the form of a physical contract document per my written request to do so - the account is classified as "" UNVERIFIED '' and under the FCRA -all UNVERIFIED accounts MUST BE DELETED. 
*The FCRA requires that all Credit Reporting Agencies or "" CRA 's '' VERIFY ALL INFORMATION received from creditors BEFORE this information is added to my credit file. Proper Verification According to case law : the CRA/Bureau must have copies of the ORIGINAL SIGNED APPLICATION in THEIR FILES!

( 2 ) Disclosure in writing. Except as provided in subsection ( b ), the disclosures required to be made under section 609 [ 1681g ] shall be provided under that section in writing. 
Hence, since I as the consumer have asked the Bureaus/CRAs to VERIFY the information being reported on my credit report, IN WRITING AND PROPERLY IDENTIFIED MYSELF ( Driver 's License & Social Security Card ) equifax is required to disclose the documents in which they are required to have on file ( original signed application ) or remove them immediately!

577676,Mortgage,"My mortgage is with OCWEN. Each year when they renew my loan information I end up short in my escrow due to homeowners insurance going up or something they 've done. I always pay the difference so I can keep my monthly payment the same since I live on a budget. I called to verify the amount short and asked if it would remain the same if I paid the shortage or a little more, the lady with OCWEN said if I paid little more than what was short, it should be at the same payment or even a little less. I wrote a check for a few dollars more than what the shortage was & mailed it on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called OCWEN to see if they received the check because it still had not cleared my bank ; and what my payment would be. The lady I spoke with said yes they had received it and applied it, however my payment went UP a few more dollars instead of going down or remaining the same. So I paid a little more than what was owed according to the contract paperwork OCWEN sent me. I asked why and she said because my insurance went up. I told her they have never done business with me this way and that my payment should stay the same as it did in the previous years. She said they do n't allow the amount to go back to what it was anymore, I asked why & she said because my insurance went up. I mentioned again that this is what they stated on the XX/XX/XXXX updated loan contract, why does she keep blaming it on the insurance going up, it goes up every year and this has never been the issue. She said they just do n't put it back to the original amount anymore. So I said, not only did I pay more than what they said it would be short ; my payment is going up more, so I 'm just giving them extra money for nothing. Needless to say I 'm currently looking into refinancing with another company. Also as of today XX/XX/XXXX, the check I sent them on XX/XX/XXXX still has not cleared my bank, so I 'm going to call them again to inquire about it. OCWEN is a nightmare. I have never been late on a payment yet I 'm being treated as if I were not the customer but in debt to them regardless. Several years ago I had to file a complaint because I was paying a little extra and marking the appropriate box where I wanted this extra $ to go. OCWEN never applied it to my choice, they applied it to their choice so it messed my finances up. They eventually fixed it after I got a lawyer involved. Shame on these big bully companies for pushing around EXCELLENT customer. I have thorough documentation regarding the two conversations I had with the two OCWEN representatives, names and ID # 's."

Your mortgage servicer handles the day-to-day tasks of managing your loan. Your loan servicer typically processes your loan payments, responds to borrower inquiries, keeps track of principal and interest paid, manages your escrow account, and may initiate foreclosure if you miss too many loan payments. Your servicer may or may not be the same company that gave you your loan. '' Specifically, we are disputing a ) the identity of a true secured lender. Because of extensive criminal activity and fraud in this arena, we require proof of the chain of secured ownership from the original alleged lender to the alleged current lender. Further, we require proof that you are the entity that has been contracted to work on behalf of the alleged lender. I would also like to state that there is a difference between a LENDER, a SERVICER and an INVESTOR. We are specifically asking WHO THE LENDER is and this is the question that needs to be answered."

The guy told me if the creditor replies back and says its validated, they will not remove it. THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE LAW. Section ( 609 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is a Consumers Disclosure section which is to provide for the protection of consumers against false and erroneous reporting. This section of the FCRA places the burden upon the Credit Bureaus and the Creditor to prove an account is yours. To positively prove an account is yours, the creditor must provide the Credit Bureau a copy of the original creditor 's documentation ( whatever you filled out and signed upon opening the account with the reporting creditor ). They are leaving it up to these scam collection agencies to validate the debt. I asked to speak to a Supervisor and he refused to let me speak to XXXX.

618807,Credit card,I have asked Key Bank to lower my monthly minimum payment on the two accounts that I have with them.

I have struggled through 4 1/2 year of making these payment but now since my balances have went down considerably from roughly {$24000.00} down to {$3400.00} I need my minimum payments recalculated to whats allowed by law. I have talked to Key Bank up management and they will not lower my minimum. I think its a disgrace for a person trying to do the right thing gets no consideration. I am currently trying to refinance my home but would not be able to with these current monthly minimum payment on credit card accounts. I will still pay more on these accounts to eliminate them but I need my minimum payments to reflect less so my debt to income ratio will work with my refi. My mimimum payment should probably be no more than {$75.00} or {$100.00} dollars. Even before I went into the debt management program my accounts were not past due. I have always paid them on time well before I got in the program.

I conducted my exit walk through with my witnesses and inspector. I video taped and photographed everything.

Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX hired Professional Debt Mediation to report fraudulent and intention inaccurate negative account information on my credit report. My tenancy was paid for the required 12 mos. period. The XXXX XXXX XXXX Staff are very dishonest 1 ). reporting damages that DID NOT EXIST, 2 ). intentionally employing tactics to extend my lease with threats of legal action, without responding to my numerous written and in-person requests for validation of terms & required notice, and 3 ). failing to honor their landlord, procedural, and contractual obligations"
44921,Debt collection,"To Whom It May Concern, In the attached statement are duplicated and incorrect charges I received from XXXX XXXX Apartments. I pointed out the damages to apartment # XXXX as well as the dirty conditions upon move-in on XXXX/XXXX/2013. These are clearly damages and cleanliness issues they are trying to charge me with in the move-out statement which clearly do not belong to me. I had reported these conditions to the leasing office before and after move in and they never made it a point to have them fixed or cleaned. The charges related to the damages and cleanliness conditions have to be removed from the balance to be paid. 

I have kept frequent communication with the leasing office and the collections agency via email. I have also visited the leasing office to submit my supporting documents and to receive the corrected balance, but I was told by the manager, XXXX XXXX, that they have to review the information.

I would like to have this resolved in a timely manner and ask for your cooperation and advise. Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.

187804,Credit reporting,I moved out of my apartment and had a disputed balance owed. The company sent me the final amount owing and after negotiating we agreed on the amount owed. We also agreed on XXXX payments that would pay my account in full. After agreeing on the payment schedule they informed the credit bureau that I did n't pay in full. I have the letter that says it 's paid in full from them. They will not contact the bureau on my behalf and said its up to me to resolve. I have the emails that show I was waiting for an accounting of the balance owed before I paid. When they said I could pay in two payments I thought this as resolved. I told them how important my credit score was to me. Not sure what I can do to get this off my bureau?
4197,Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2017, I called KeyBank and made a XXXX payment. ( payment cleared XX/XX/2017 ) I was told by the KeyBank representative when taking my bank information this payment would bring my account current and I would be due for the XX/XX/2017 payment. ( Recorded phone call will confirm this ) I then made arrangement with KeyBank for the XX/XX/2017 payment. 
On XX/XX/2017 I receive a certified "" Notice of Default and Intention to Accelerate '' dated XX/XX/2017 from KeyBank 's attorney XXXX. The reinstatment amount in the letter was XXXX as of XX/XX/2017. ( Recall that Keybank accepted my XXXX payment on XX/XX/2017 and told me I was current. ) I also noticed my login with KeyBank has been "" locked '' due for Security reasons. 
On XX/XX/2017 I called KeyBank and spoke with XXXX in the Real Estate / Collections department. I explained to him that I was current and confused on why I received a certified threatening letter from XXXX XXXX. I also told XXXX I was calling to make the XX/XX/2017 as pre-arranged. He told me the XX/XX/2017 payment ( XXXX ) has not been applied to my account ( just sitting there ). XXXX then stated, the KeyBank Representative that I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX who also took my XXXX payment to bring my account current told me everything wrong. She lied he indicated. XXXX now told me I had to call attorney office of XXXX and request a reinstatment letter. XXXX futher went on to say that I had to pay with certified funds only. This is really unsettling considering the Notice of Default that I just received makes no indication of this "" certified funds '' request or has any KeyBank employee ever told me I had to pay with "" certified funds. '' I went on to explain to XXXX that my funds cleared my bank on XX/XX/2017 and the XXXX payment was good and thus, "" certified ''. Again, I explained to XXXX I was not delinquent. XXXX then went on to say KeyBank will be mailing my XXXX back in the mail. XXXX appeared to have no clue on the status of the payment and a check being mailed. 
I am not sure why Key Bank is treating me like this. I paid the account current, Keybank took and accepted the payment on XX/XX/2017. I never heard from XXXX after the XX/XX/2017 payment was accepted until I unexpectedly received the "" Notice of Default '' dated XX/XX/2017. I have always told Keybank I am keeping the house, I live in the house and I want to work with them. I also mailed a Modification packet to Keybank at the end of last year and now Key Bank has told me they have no proof of receipt. Also, during my phone call with XXXX XXXX he started to get an upset, loud and then he hung up on me during the conversation. ( recorded conversation will confirm ) I called right back."

The hold did not qualify under the exception rules at all and they were told that and still kept the hold in place long after the cashiers check cleared. I want some sort of sanctions or formal reprimand placed against B of A for not following the rules and I should be given both an apology and some sort of monetary compensation for damaging my payment record with my lender and causing me to drive 3 hours 3 times out of state to the nearest B of A while I was on vacation to try to handle the problem.

Our expectation was that they would be receptive to helping us since they received XXXX dollars in bailout funds to help homeowners and still have XXXX dollars left to provide assistance for those in need. Instead of getting assistance and a lending hand, we were not provided with a full review for retention options on our property, but given a streamline medication on our FHA loan. We were never provided with a review for assistance based on our household income, but rather just offered an off the shelf modification that is a bit beyond our threshold to pay. What about offering us a true FHA Modification, or a Special Forebearance, or a Partial Claim? We are qualified for ALL of these programs, but Chase just has taken the easy route and thrown us the worst offer they could muster. The worst part is that they gave this modification in XX/XX/XXXX AND WE HAVE NOW MADE FIVE TRIAL PAYMENTS, BUT THEY WO N'T GIVE US A FINAL MODIFICATION OR EVEN TALK TO US!!! We are absolutely stuck and feel as though we are throwing good money after bad while Chase is winding up their process to foreclose on our home.

However, we can not get any traction or a straight answer from and have been denied us access to government programs designed to help homeowners.

Life was fine and we had a very strong mortgage payment history until I was injured and then it appears that Chase has turned their backs on us.

475871,Consumer Loan,"I acquired a new XXXX automobile XX/XX/XXXX. The vehicle lease was set up ( by XXXX XXXX ) through US Bank. I had no choice in selection of the lending institution. I am the only signatory on the contract ( there is no co-lessee ). It is a 36-month lease with monthly payments of {$1500.00}. I received my first invoice from US Bank by mail on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( mailed to my home address ) in amount of {$1500.00} ; the first payment was made over the Internet on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. When the initial payment was made my wife requested "" paperless '' billing. We were told by US Bank that we would not receive bills in the mail but we would receive invoices via email. 

I received no further invoices from US Bank, either in the mail or via email. Furthermore, I received no emails, phone calls or other correspondence from US Bank regarding my account ( and will so testify under penalty of perjury ). My next contact with US bank was a letter ( sent to my home address ) dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, informing me that my monthly payment, due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, was past due. The letter indicated the total amount due was {$3000.00} and stated that US Bank had already reported me to credit bureaus. 

Upon receipt of the letter, I immediately contacted US Bank and made payment in full of everything owed ( including a penalty for late payment ). I explained to US Bank that I had never received any invoices by mail, or email or any phone calls, and therefore was unaware I was behind in my payments. I understood the logic regarding the penalty for a late payment ( and I readily paid the penalty ) but it seemed unjust for the bank to report me to credit bureaus when my failure to make timely payments was because the bank had failed to send me invoices. 

A representative of US Bank told me I could dispute their decision to report me to credit agencies. I filed a dispute in writing and received a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX of the bank 's Consumer Loan & Lease Operations Office in XXXX, Wisconsin, dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated, "" US Bank conducted an investigation with respect to the disputed information '' and concluded that my account "" is being reported accurately to the XXXX major consumer reporting agencies. '' I am attaching copies of correspondence and emails between me and my wife, my wife ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and US Bank, myself and US Bank, etc. documenting our efforts to resolve this injustice. 

I wrote a letter to XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX appealing that decision. It was ( and remains ) my position that it is US Bank was at fault for not billing me in timely fashion. I accept the penalty ( which I have paid ) for making my payment late, but I feel if it is egregious that I have been reported to credit bureaus and this has adversely impacted my credit rating incident. 

By way of background, I am a physician and have been in practice for 38 years. I have a very successful practice. During the past 35 years or so, I have leased a variety of cars through different banks. There has not been one single incidence where I was late in a lease payment, even one day. Furthermore, I have never been late in paying any debt, including multiple auto loans, credit cards, mortgage payments, etc. Fortunately, I have more than adequate funds at my fingertips to pay my bills and have never been reported to a credit agency for delinquency or any financial negligence. There is simply no reason at this point in my life that I would not pay an obligation - the only reason is that I was unaware that I owed the money because US bank did not invoice me. 

I politely requested of US Bank to immediately reverse the "" reports of delinquency '' to the XXXX major consumer-reporting agencies. US Bank has turned down my request and rejected my appeals. I am soliciting your assistance in getting this injustice reversed. Thank you in advance for your assistance."

164864,Mortgage,"I started a home mortgage through Homebridge Financial Services XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX GA XXXX. They are extremely difficult to make payments through their automated phone payment system unless I set up an automatic draft which I don not prefer. I prefer one time ACH drafts as I need to control the date of payment each month as I need to insure funds are available. 
Their system makes it so difficult I had to wait through extremely long and irrelevent bot messages just to get to the phone payment. Then each and every month it looks like I need to re enter my checking account info as their system will not save the info. Other mortgage agenceis can and will do that service. But that 's not the worst of the experience yet. They also require you to enter the payment amount in dollars and cents from your phone keypad even though they now what you need to pay. I had so much trouble with this ( on my second time ever doing it ) that I ended up entering a payment of only {$12.00} when I really owed around {$1100.00} I didnt even get to figure out how Im supposed to do the decimal point on my phone keypad by the time I realized I started a whole other issue now with an XXXX payment. So then I hung up had to do it all over again and waited 20 mins before I could talk to a rep whose best case scenario was to delete my {$12.00} payment and was told I had to wait till tomorrow as the system will only allow XXXX pending transaction at a time. This is a terrible system I feel is designed to create difficulty in order to ensnare the consumer in fees and interest traps. Their phone number is XXXX try it you 'll see its not right. I would also like to add that I started this loan with Homebridge ( and I wont even get into that ) but after my first payment they switched me to XXXX ( who in comparison was exemplary ) They saved my info after the first time and I would call and be done with the process in 5 or so minutes doing one time ACH drafts from my checking account ( also due to less irrelevant bot messages ). Then for some reason I dont know they switched us back from XXXX to Homebridge just a couple months ago. Thanks for taking the time to read my experience with Homebridge Financial Services and I hope it helps them make changes to their system."

I was a XXXX when I came into a financial hardship and had was not paid by the military for over 2 1/2 months. Immediately when I was told that I was not going to be paid that pay period I knew I was in trouble as my mortgage was due. Well at the time I could n't get any assistance for my mortgage and started getting behind. It was n't till end of XXXX I was getting caught up, but I was n't able to pay my balance owed and the bank would not except anything less then the full amount. I just kept getting farther and farther behind and well life happened. I would continuously call and update the bank with my info trying to get into a some program to stop my home from going into foreclosure. After XXXX chapter XXXX bankruptcies filed to postpone public auction to try and get my short sale approved, the bank finally contacted me and said that my home would be going on public auction and there is nothing I can do about it. Flagstar Bank has always been a thorn in my side and to this day they continue to still be. They are reporting the full amount of the loan XXXX is still owed on my credit report and its hurting my credit in a major way. I know the home sold for XXXX which is about where I was trying to sell my house as a short sale at, go figure that. I have recently disputed my balance on my credit report and they denied the update. I also wrote them directly and got a letter stating that they wont update to the correct balance as the foreclosure is for the full balance and will stay on my credit report for 7 years, which i know but I know that the balance of XXXX is incorrect and should be reported correctly."

774258,Mortgage,"I had mortgaged XXXX properties in XXXX separately. Several years later OCWEN LOAN SERVICING , LLC became the loan servicing company for both mortgages via XXXX different previous loan servicing companies. 1 ). One company Litton, the previous lender to XXXX present Ocwen loan, did modify my mortgage but I later learned the document I signed added {$40000.00} to my principle in order for that company, Litton, to modify the loan. This property had been owned by several other companies before Litton owned it. This was very unethical for Litton to do I feel. I was able to get the monthly loan amount decreased over time and retain the property before the loan was sold to Ocwen. Before the modification I had paid approximately XXXX years worth of payments on time before my financial difficulties developed. Ocwen phone agents have been rude, do not all give me the same consistent information when I call, typically refuse to allow me to speak with a supervisor to resolve my inquiries or just plain hang up on me or place me on indefinite telephone holds. 2 ). Ocwen would report me as late within XXXX days after the month I was late with payments up to XXXX days when I was experiencing financial difficulties. Now that my payment have been paid within the current month due, since XXXX XXXX on both loans, Ocwen can not report my payments paid since the last XXXX ( XXXX ) months. All XXXX credits agencies show me paid thru XXXX XXXX. This has the effect of keeping me from seeking possible refinancing should I want to do so. This is just wrong. Ocwen phone agents have stated Ocwen is not responsible that the credit agencies are responsible. When I submitted inquiries to the XXXX credit agencies the replies were the credit agencies report as soon as the reporting companies give them the information. If Ocwen could report within XXXX days after I was late for over XXXX days Ocwen can report in a timely manner when I have paid on time. All other of my creditors report my payments no later than XXXX days after the payments have been submitted. 3 ). Ocwen is and has been adding indiscriminately late fees to my account since servicing the loan. There are fees that I believe are incorrect and fees I have no idea why I am being charged for them. 4 ).

730036,Credit card,"AMERICAN EXPRESS MARKETING TARGETS PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS, WITH PROMISE OF BONUS SKYMILES, A MISLEADING ALGORITHM!! 
I am objecting to the ambiguous and misleading automated marketing email which was personalized with my name and email address, linked to my personal Delta Skymiles account. This is not simply a blanket marketing tactic. This marketing tactic specifically targets past consumers. The policies are ambiguously worded to make a previous customer believe that the product offered includes a welcome bonus of XXXX skymiles plus a {$50.00} credit, and {$95.00} annual fee waved the first year. AmEx refused to honor my welcome bonus and insists that the terms are clearly defined as this welcome bonus "" not applying if you have had the product in the last 12 months. '' "" Product '' I thought meant welcome bonus, which I had not obtained for 18 months. Further example of ambiguity is that the normal annual fee is waved for the first year as part of the "" welcome bonus. '' That particular benefit of the "" welcome bonus '' was indeed honored! What does that imply to the average consumer? That the annual fee being waved for a year being honored, indicates the welcome bonus will be honored.These welcome benefits, including the annual fee being waved, are listed in the same list. ( see attached ) Because of the ambiguity of the offer, I was skeptical. I initially interpreted the invitation being offered to me as a "" welcome back bonus. '' The automated confirmation letter of my approval clearly said "" welcome back. '' ( see attached ) There clearly was an algorithm in this specific offer that recognized previous customers. 

The way AmEx operates their marketing to previous customers is obviously targeted to make us think we will get the welcome ( "" back '' ) bonus. That is how the marketing is designed. Even the small print in the terms ambiguously states that the welcome bonus is not available to any who have had the "" product '' ( interpreted as welcome bonus since it was in a footnote for "" welcome bonus '' ) in the last 12 months. I had obtained the welcome bonus XX/XX/2013, 18 months prior. 

Why could n't the marketing email clearly state the terms as "" welcome bonus skymiles and {$50.00} credit are not available for customers who have had a Delta Gold AmEx card in the last 12 months, but the annual fee will still be waved for a year.. ''?? I would have easily understood and then based my decision to reopen my account in comparison to other credit cards that offer welcome bonus miles. The terms are specifically worded in an ambiguous misleading way, easily misinterpreted. I would have most likely opened an account elsewhere as I am in urgent need of skymiles. This deceptive marketing tactic has disrupted my urgent travel needs and may prevent me from being able to afford family emergency travel, as I have had to use my existing skymiles repeatedly for family emergencies already. 

The reason I did not document my initial AmEx phone call wherein AmEx Customer Service team DID verify the welcome bonus offer as applying to me, a previous customer, was that I believed the answer that AmEx customer service provided, verifying the welcome bonus as applying to me. If I had not believed it, I would have documented that initial inquiry for further verification. Previously AmEx customer service teams have been competent in explaining policies. I am shocked that as a one time courtesy AmEx still refuses to honor my welcome bonus of XXXX skymiles, which I interpreted to mean "" welcome Back bonus '' as even the confirmation automated email recognized me and said "" welcome back. '' Listed below are the XXXX members of AmEx General XXXX that I emailed about this issue, and see attached response from the Customer Advocate Team.

472793,Consumer Loan,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I was in an accident where my car was totaled by the other party. The insurance company as well as I have been requesting documents from Ally Financial to send so they are paid. I have called every other day since finding out that car was totaled and what was needed for the insurance company to issue payment. Ally has sent the documents twice with the wrong information which is baffling to me because I was on the phone when the Ally rep repeated the correct amount to the insurance agent. I, along with an insurance representative spoke to a representative for Ally on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2015 and we were told that it could be another week before they receive the proper documents. This alone poses another problem because interest is accruing during this process and my Gap insurance ca n't payout until the insurance company pays and the insurance company ca n't pay until they receive the proper documents from Ally. This has been frustrating and very time consuming with the numerous calls that have been made and the wait times to speak with someone. In addition to the documents being delayed an insurance rep and myself spoke with an Ally representative on XXXX XXXX, 2015 who knowingly lied about faxing documents and saying they would be received within an hour. The Ally rep was caught in the lie when the insurance rep asked her to verify the information and she could n't. This has made me believe that Ally is n't interested in closing out this account and surely not in a timely manner."

When Greentree acquired our mortgage I was at a XXXX with my wife and out of the loop for over 60 days ( XXXX to XXXX ). I continued sending our payments to XXXX, they in turn sent the payments on to Green tree. Greentree jumped our payments, stating our Escrow account was delinquent. It was not, but we sent the extra amount without question. At the end of the year they had to return the overage back to us, some {$920.00} by federal law. Ditech tried the same thing about the Escrow account. We ignored the the request because we had received some {$1400.00} with the understanding it was an overage to our Escrow account from Greentree. We continued sending our original amount and have never been late nor missed a payment to Ditech. Ditech and Greentree tried to force us into refinancing by threatening foreclosure. We were referred to XXXX. We would have been approved and charged {$3000.00} and returned to Ditech as our mortgage holder. We refused the loan and continued to make our original payments. About 2 months back we received a package in the mail to reduce our payments from the original amount of {$630.00} to $ XXXX and adding the famous {$3000.00} to our $ XXXX amount left on the mortgage. We called for a final payoff and found Ditech had jumped our mortgage by {$3000.00} without our approval. We have been sending our payments of {$630.00} registered with a return receipt to prove we did not approve their offer. We have sent a complaint to Oregon Dept. of Justice and to the state agency that approved Ditech to operate in the State of Oregon.

It did not end, I called back in XXXX and the charges kept piling up for a phone I had not used since XXXX 2016. On XXXX XXXX, I called and asked what is the remaining balance to clear our account? The XXXX representative told me the total was {$97.00}. I paid the {$97.00} and was assured the remaining balance was {$0.00} and that the phone would be disconnected on XXXX XXXX with no further charges.The plan for the last number was finally disconnected on XXXX XXXX. However, XXXX kept accumulating the charges. I called once again in XXXX and explained to the representative what had happened since XXXX and he told me you have to pay up which I did not. XXXX then sent the account which is under my brother 's name to a collecting agency. 

I must also inform you that on XXXX separate occasions the XXXX representative agreed that there was no phone usage and we would not be continued to be charged. She mentioned to me it 's a glitch in our system but it should be taken care of soon. Unfortunately, it was n't and the charges kept piling up. Now, they tell me the current balance is {$140.00}.

579194,Mortgage,In 2015 I was approved for the Florida Hardest Hit Program where that program paid my mortgage payments for 12 months due to my hardship. I also was approved for the amount of {$18000.00} that would have went toward a portion of my amount to reinstate my mortgage but my Servicer refused those funds because it was not the total amount to reinstate. I recently completed my participation with the Hardest Hit Program and due to a decrease in my income I went to a HUD approved HUD Counseling agency to applying for a loan modification and the servicer has informed me that due to my mortgage being 3 years in arrears and a new rule set forth by CFPB they can not open a file for me to be considered for a retention option. I feel this is an unfair ruling based on if my servicer would have taken the {$18000.00} I was approved for by the HHF Program that would decreased the amount of delinquency and would have helped me in my attempt to save my home form foreclosure. I recently have increased my income and I am seeking a favorable solution to save my home.

After not hearing anything for quite some time, I reached out to my loan processor to ask for the status. He stated my loan went dormant because they were awaiting a csubordination with the title company. Due to internal priorities at Freedom Mortgage, loan refinancing takes a backseat to new purchases. My loan was not a priority for them and it clearly showed. To make things worse, I received an email ( not a phone call ) from my loan processor 3 weeks after my loan had been closed stating that I need to reapply."

I will make the payment that they state was missing from XX/XX/XXXX. I do n't know what the resolution is for them as they have given me false information regarding the debt over the phone and were very rude when I tried to explain that they payment in question was not missed in XX/XX/XXXX. A fair resolution would be for them to reimburse me for the payment that they state was missed and apply it to my account since they were not honest about what they were trying to collect."

I told them this is not acceptable this is an ATM at their financial location owned by them a location they are planning to close at the end of the month and while I was sitting there on Sat other clients told me the other ATM were not working.

I would like Experian to know that I did in-fact send them a letter disputing information on my credit report. I also give Experian my expressed and written consent to continue with the investigation of my accounts per the dispute letter I wrote to them. 
Since I have not experienced this situation before, I would very much appreciate Experian providing me with an explanation of my rights specifically pertaining to how I am allowed to dispute information on my credit report. 
I would also like to know specifically what made my letter "" suspicious '' and why Experian thinks I did not write my letter to them. Did I say something in my letter that they think I am not smart enough to write myself? 
I have reviewed Experian 's website to determine what steps I am required to take to dispute my accounts and thought I had followed all instructions : I sent in a copy of my ID, proof of my social security number and proof of my address.

I would like Experian to let me know if I am allowed to re-write my letter, and if so, would Experian be so kind as to provide me with an example of a letter that would be acceptable to them? 
I am just a regular person and do not have the money to be represented by an attorney or any other agency. I work all day and can not afford to take time off work to dispute my accounts. So I would like Experian to tell me if completing a dispute over the phone would provide me with the same outcome as a letter?

Ally had no right to cash a check that did n't belong to them at all. I tried speaking to a supervisor but of course I was told XXXX to 72 hours before I would be able to talk with someone. My question is why would they cash my check when the balance is zero and then hold my check until 15 days? I 'm not really happy with them and cashing of my check they could have returned it or signed off on it and sent it to me to worry about a dealership check clearing. Not to mention checks clear now within XXXX to 2 business days due to check XXXX when that took place. Meanwhile, I 'm the one who is waiting for my check that I 'm entitled to especially when there is no Balance and my account was closed.

I informed the representative none of this was ever stated to me when I applied for and was approved for the "" loan ''. His response was "" well this is how a payday loan works ''.

212351,Credit card,"American Express engaged in billing practices that were unfair and unpredictable, and resulted in wrongful interest charges of {$560.00} on my account since XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to contact American Express about these matters on several occasions, and was told that I would receive a call back from a supervisor in the credit department, but to date I have not. 

I use the charge type breakdown tool on American Express 's website to pay my credit card charges in an itemized fashion for easy track-back for accounting purposes later. Apparently I made a miscalculation when paying my XX/XX/XXXX credit card bill, and fell short of the total amount due by {$74.00}. But the interest charge that American Express charged me was calculated against the entire statement 's balance, not only the portion left over after I paid the rest of the bill. Given the amount of the unpaid portion of the bill, the amount of interest charged was well in excess of the stated APR, and indeed, in excess of the legal limit for most transactions in the XXXX. 

On the XX/XX/XXXX bill, AMEX showed a balance of XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX, and payments had been received in the amount of {$7700.00}, plus credits had been applied in the amount of {$440.00}, for a remaining balance of {$74.00}. But AMEX charged me {$100.00} in interest. The remaining balance was just {$74.00}, so the interest charged was in fact 147 % of the amount remaining, not 19.24 % ( my published APR ). When I contacted AMEX to request that the interest charge be corrected or reversed, I was told that I had "" forfeited '' the interest "" waiver '' by failing to pay the entire month 's amount due in full, so interest would be charged against the entire month -- not just the unpaid portion. I was also told that I would henceforth be charged interest on ALL monthly statements. 

In light of this experience, I have tried to ensure that I pay down each itemized portion of my bill in full -- again, using the category-by-category tool provided by AMEX. I have multiple categories to pay down, including transportation, office supplies, meals, etc., and after attempting to submit multiple payments -- XXXX per category -- on my XX/XX/XXXX bill, I received an error message from the website, telling me that I could only submit XXXX payments per day. This was unknown to me at the time, and I am still unaware of where this policy is written on the AMEX website. It also seems unintuitive because the category-by-category tool has more than XXXX categories ; I ca n't believe I am the only person who has attempted to divide payments by category. 

I called AMEX because I was attempting to pay down my bill on the day it was due, so if I had to pay the rest of the bill the following day, I would end up late again and I was afraid of receiving an interest charge based on the entire month 's bill, not only the unpaid portion. He reiterated the XXXX-per-day policy ( I have yet to see this in writing ), and offered to get AMEX 's credit department on the phone to help me put through payments in advance of the XXXX XXXX Mountain Time payment cutoff time. Moments later he said that because XX/XX/XXXX -- the bill due date -- was a Sunday, the credit office was closed. I would be unable to submit the rest of my payments, but someone would contact me to take the rest of the payments and reverse any interest charges that were applied in light of my inability to submit the rest of the payments ( especially if that interest rate was based on the full month 's bill ). Unfortunately, no one has contacted me to date. 

( Finally : AMEX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX cutoff for payments is a source of great confusion, even for a customer that has been a customer for over a decade. It was described to me for the XXXX time by a phone agent last fall. This confusion resulted in some interest charges that I am requesting to be refunded under this complaint. )"

He assured me that we would not be paying any of the closing costs for the second refinance, as it was their mistake, and they would drop our interest rate .5 % to match the payment amount as close as they could to the refinance amount.

Talk about starting off a new relationship on the wring foot. As a consumer, I feel cheated and that Citibank purposely misrepresented this information to their customers to incite purchases for which they never intented to honor interest free promotions. This is a classic bait and switch marketing technique that should not be allowed. This is illegal and predatory behavior. I envision a class action suit in the near future for this and other woes encountered when the cards were transferred without consumer consent and any type of honest communication about the terms of the new agreement. Citibank should be ashamed of these practices, did these institutions learn nothing from the collapse they caused barely less than a decade ago??? I contacted customer service of course, and was granted relief on ONE month 's interest. But that does not help me because I had planned to pay off this balance over the 12 months I was promised.

153074,Mortgage,"My mortgage refinancing closed on XX/XX/XXXX. A check for approximately {$5600.00} for the amount of funds in the old escrow account with PHH MORTGAGE was supposed to be mailed to us within 2 weeks from XX/XX/XXXX ( the closing was actually on XX/XX/XXXX but we were told it took 7 days to officially close out ). Since this is a large sum of cash we have been following up since XX/XX/XXXX as to the status and whereabouts of the check. To sum it up we have been following up weekly since then and have been given numerous explanations and conflicting stories regarding the date the check was sent, the dates we should receive the check, and when the "" receive by '' dates have lapsed we have been told to wait another week. We were told last Monday that if we had n't received the check by this Monday ( yesterday ), they would overnight the check by today. Today when we spoke with them they said they actually ca n't do that, and if they ever do agree to do that, then it would take 10 days to accomplish it. At the end of the discussion with PHH tonight we were again told that they would continue to look into it and see what they could do. Once again, More than 45 days from the original closing date, they could not give us a definitive answer as to the whereabouts of the check they say was processed and sent out on XX/XX/XXXX. What warrants concern to us is the sheer amount of seemingly unending excuses and lack of a definitive resolution timeframe this company has demonstrated, a behavior that we have never experienced with a bank. We were told today that if they cancel the check, they have 10 days to "" process '' it before they even mail it out. And then they said it takes 21 days in the mail without receiving it before they get concerned. I find this strange since in reality the US mail is very reliable and seldom does it take longer than 5 business days to receive something from anywhere in the country, let alone XXXX to XXXX. 
Our primary issues are : - Multiple claims about the date the escrow check was sent- The check never arrives by the date they say it should- They are unwilling to overnight the check today as they promised last Monday- We were told they canceled the check tonight, but now have to investigate whether the check was cashed before they resend another ( they ca n't quickly determine that? ) - When we asked if there is a date when they finally reach a point where they simply set their normal process aside and overnight our money to us, they state there is n't one- As of now, there is no definitive date that we may count on to have the {$5600.00} received that is owed to us. 
Our final concern is that in talking with the "" always polite '' individuals at PHH Mortgage, there is an air of dishonesty surrounding the whereabouts of our escrow money. The absolute inability to resolve the issue coupled with a never ending runaround on how we have to wait, wait, and wait even longer calls into question the legal operation of this banking institution and whether it has issues with where it keeps escrow funds, how it uses them while it is supposed to be safeguarding them, and whether or not our escrow funds are even available to PHH, if they are even in their "" possession '' at this time. I fear in the worst case PHH may be misappropriating escrow funds they are charged with safeguarding for proper disbursement."

Around this time, XXXX XXXX reported a collection activity to TransUnion ; and my credit score was immediately affected.

159362,Credit card,"The following letter was sent to American Express : American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX To whom it may concern, I am writing to express my concern with how American Express has treated card holders of 19 years. 

On XXXX XXXX we called to ask that our American Express XXXX account be put on hold. We were in XXXX XXXX had misplaced our card ( with our second card being left at home ). We thought we knew its location, but wanted to put a hold on it in case it was lost. We were told that you ca n't put a card on hold, so they would cancel it and issue a new one. We asked that they do n't cancel it since we were on vacation and thought we knew the location. The agent apologized, explaining it was already cancelled even though we did not ask for this. The agent had us hold for a supervisor who explained that the agent was accurate in stating it ca n't be put on hold, but assured us it was reactivated. 

The next day, XXXX XXXX, the card was declined. We made other arrangements to pay the bill presented to us and called American Express again. XXXX, the supervisor we were directed to, was wonderful ; she understood the problem, took ownership for the mistake ( questioning why the original request for hold was n't handled by simply lowering our credit to {$1.00} ), and credited us XXXX XXXX points for our time, embarrassment and your error. She also assured us she took the necessary steps to ensure that the card worked. Our trust in American Express was restored. 

It would be nice if this was the end of the story, but it is not. The card did not work. Over the next week we figured out that the slide option on the card worked, but chip function did not work. Whenever we tried to use the chip we would get the message, "" not accepted. '' With more businesses taking the chip than the swipe, this was a huge problem. Over the next week ( mostly on vacation ) we called REPEATEDLY. Each time we were assured that the chip worked and there was no record of any denials. We assured them that this was not the case and even took a video of an attempt to use the chip at XXXX, but there is according to repeated agents it is not for an agent, supervisor or manager to receive an email or text message. We were also told that a manager would have to call us to work on this issue. Beginning XXXX XXXX, we were promised a manager would call within 24 hours. In total we were promised four times a manager would call ( after no one called with XXXX hours - we were promised a manager would call by XXXX, so XXXX waited away from the family for the call ; a third time we were told to wait for a call from a manager named XXXX, and finally I was given the option of leaving a voicemail for a XXXX named XXXX XXXX ). NONE of these managers EVER called back. The only manager we ever spoke with ( see the call prior to a conversation with an agent named XXXX ) happened when we refused to hang up until we spoke with a manager. After a long hold of about twenty minutes we were "" disconnected '' and she did not call us back. XXXX explained that there was record of a call but no notes recorded at all. The ironic thing is : if any of the agents understood the issue, all they would have had to do was overnight a new card to a hotel we were to be staying at. Instead, each time a promise of a solution was made. 

We felt we were treated fairly up the point where XXXX worked with us. With the XXXX points ( the value of one nice hotel room ) being a fair compensation for the genuine mistakes on day one, we feel that a similar value should be placed on each of the different errors, lies, lack of trust, broken promises and poorly handled situations. In other word, an additional credit of XXXX XXXX points would be less per mistake than the XXXX that XXXX thought fit for the"

I discovered that it was a collection business called IC Systems. I further found hundreds of complaints from other people following their dealing with this company.

Once he was on the phone he also repeated the same line about needing to confirm who I was before he could provide any further information. I explained to him again that I would not be providing any personal information and since he or his company were the ones who had contacted me, they needed to be the ones that were forth coming with information, since I had no way to "" prove '' who he was. I also explained that I viewed their telephone communication with me to be harassment and that I demanded my number be removed from their calling list. He said that he could do that and would. If I owe a debt that I am unaware of fine, but how about calling and saying, Yes this is so and so and we have been retained by so and so to attempt to collect a debt that they claim you owe them. At this point I would have the ability to research for myself if I had forgotten something and get back with them.

I immediately contacted this agency to pay off the debt so that it would n't have to be reported. The representative of the debt collection agency ( Rent Recovery ), XXXX, was very dishonest about this matter from the very beginning. He told me that this debt would not be reported on my credit as long as I maintained the payment plan that was in place. I set up the payment plan after I received communication from the original debtor, XXXX, without hesitancy. I checked my credit after receiving notification about a new account, and discovered that this had been reported since XX/XX/XXXX - approximately ONE WEEK after I moved! I contacted XXXX and he advised me that he would check with some "" department '' to see why it was reported and have it removed. I disputed the debt, stating that he told me it would not be reported. The debt was never removed. I made consistent, on-time payments - they were set up as a direct withdrawal from my bank account.

I informed him that I reached out regarding the XX/XX/XXXX payment a couple times. He told me they had given my account to a new tech center and the payment was missed, but since it was the "" holiday '' he thought I could use the break. ( I never asked for a break. ) I informed him that I would like to make the payment at month end, per the normal agreement. He said he would reach out to yet another team to see if this was ok and get back with me. He then called back saying the payment was due in full. I told him I was unable to pay it in full and I felt it was unfair seeing as how the new XXXX company caused me to miss the XX/XX/XXXX payment. He became very aggressive and said "" well this is your debt, you knew about it, had the money and decided not to pay me. '' I told him, very shocked at his attitude, that I did not have the money at the time which is why I asked for it to be paid at month end ( per the usual agreement ). After being unable to reach a resolution, I informed him that I would be disputing the debt.

Also, where in my mortgage document with XXXX XXXX ( the original mortgage holder ) does it even mention "" protective advances '' or anything like them?

Both checks cleared my credit union account with the amount deducted the next business day. Regions has almost XXXX week later now held these funds for fraud monitoring till next month even though they have received these funds. They claim a confidential source has indicated that the checks may not clear. They have also retroactively returned ACH payments from different merchants and banks well after they were approved. I contacted the local branch in my city who said that only the branch where the account was opened, which is out of state, could assist. Regions has received an almost {$20000.00} interest free loan from me, is holding our money without any ability to access it, creating return check fees to our credit card and auto loan institutions and damaging our internal ratings, and insulted us with a claim of confidential information of non-payment. This claim is patently false as the account the check is drawn from is my own and my credit union has already sent them the funds. I believe this claim is used as an unsubstantiated excuse."
228914,Debt collection,"To whom it may concern, I have leased a vehicle from XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX from an auto leasing corp. I paid for the rental with my credit card. The credit card guarantees auto insurance in case of damage to the vehicle. 
I returned the vehicle on XXXX XXXX and they found a dent on the fender. As a responsible citizen trying to do the right thing, I filled out the damage report. I contacted my credit card who opened a case and subsequently a claim for me. Card benefit services sent me a list of documents needed from the auto rental corporation, and the damage recovery unit sent over some of the required documents. Card benefit services acknowledged receiving the documents and requested the rest of the documents be sent. 
The damage recovery unit put a representative in charge of my case, whom I have tried to contact both through phone and email on numerous occasions, which is documented in the attached files. He has yet to communicate with me regarding the "" debt '', despite my efforts to reach him. 
I have requested repeatedly from the damage recovery unit to receive the documents needed in order for my credit card to process my claim. Some of these calls and E-mails are in the attached files. Though I was never successful to speak to the recovery specialist in charge of my case, ( he was repeatedly out of town or out of the office, despite the assurance that I can contact him directly at any time ), I was able to speak to several other representatives, who guaranteed that my documents would be sent to the credit card company. As of today XXXX/XXXX/2015, it has not been sent. 
I was sent a demand letter on XXXX/XXXX/2015 from the recovery specialist in charge of my case with a ten days ' notice to repay my debt before my case will be handed over to a collection agency ( see attached Demand E-mail file ). I am in the process of applying for a unit in the XXXX that requires top security clearance, and unsatisfactory credit will disqualify me from being accepted into the unit. I E-mailed them back on XXXX/XXXX/2015 ( see attached response to Demand E-mail file ). I did not receive a response so I called the damage recovery unit on XXXX/XXXX/2015 I demanded to speak to the specialist who signed the demand letter, but was told it is not possible. I did speak to a different specialist who guaranteed me, that the documents would be sent over. She also told me to disregard the demand letter ( see "" told to disregard the demand letter '' recording ( XXXX ) ). 
On XXXX/XXXX/2015, seven days after receiving the demand letter, I received a letter from a collection agency, although the damage recovery unit guaranteed me XXXX days in the demand letter. ( See attached "" Transmittal demand Letter '' file, and "" Demand E-mail '' file ). This means my credit was negatively affected, concurrently affecting my acceptance into the XXXX unit I am actively trying to join. 
I contacted the damage recovery unit on XXXX/XXXX/2015, and was once again not able to speak to the representative charged with my case. The representative I spoke with admitted that the situation I am in is due to their incompetence, but still refused to cancel the debt with the collection agency, even though it will damage my credit ( see "" final conversation with damage recovery unit '' recording ( XXXX until end ) ). 
As of XXXX/XXXX/2015 they still did not send the necessary documents to the card benefit services, who still have an open claim on my behalf. ( see "" letter from benefit services '' file, "" benefit services not received necessary documents '' recording ). 
I will contact a lawyer and file a lawsuit if this matter is not resolved, as their misconduct will disqualify me from the XXXX unit that has been my lifelong dream to join. The mental anguish it will cause me is not something I can describe in this letter."

Because I am twice widowed and have no financial help, my credit has been dinged during this recession and need some help with moving because my job offer is a XXXX drive one way from my home. 
Of course the first guy I talked to strung me a lot to believe it would not be a problem, so that he could get an application and run a credit check on me to save his own job, which of course then pulls my score down even further and keeps me from getting any help from anyone, then he turns me down saying it is due to past due payments. Is that not want I told him I called to get a loan for and fix to begin with? The amount for the refinance was within his limits for my vehicle, but still turned me down for the payments being late on it, which I told him was why I called to get the loan. Why would he run a credit bureau on me and further damage my score? I then asked to talk to a loan XXXX because he had no answers for any of my questions. She was just as bad or worse, had no compassion, rude and disrespectful, when I asked her what other ideas she could give me in my situation, she said none, she did not know, said they do n't give credit counseling. 
Both of them were so incompetent. I then decided, based on this experience to close my savings account with them, which only has XXXX dollars in it and if they could not help me with such a small issue as what I brought to them, do not need them in the future and account being open is not helping me in anyway, only them to help them meet their quotas. I then called back and spoke with XXXX and she was just as rude. I told her I wanted to shut the savings account down, which is the only account I have with them. 
She said she sent a message to the department that closing them to do so but they may be gone for the day and she said she would mail me a check for my XXXX dollars. It was after XX/XX/XXXX, but not closing time. I asked her to give me a time frame of when it would be closed. She then put me on hold and said she would take care of it. She came back and said it had been closed. Then I get up this morning and there are XXXX different emails in my email account from them confirming my request to stop online delivery of statements, which I never did, and claiming they would have to charge me a dollar per statement going forward on all my account unless I have a checking with XXXX balance. Then another email about my credit card statement when I do n't and never have had a credit card with them. 
They are simply trying to find some way to illegally hold onto my measly XXXX dollars. Note I never emailed or contacted them to request anything, so have no idea why they sent all of these emails. I only requested by phone yesterday XX/XX/XXXX that they close my savings account and send me the balance of what is in the account by mail. I have worked for several banks in the past and left them for this and other reasons, Pentagon Federal is just like them. I want to get away from banks and credit unions completely and would encourage all to do so. They are greedy and intentionally incompetent and the same kind of people work in all of them, the kind of people I do n't want anything to do with.

So, happened again this month on my other B of A account, made my payment, still showed due. So I started an online chat a few days ago and the rep said they would fix it. They did not. I have now been on the phone for almost an hour with B of A and they are saying all they can do is reverse the payment I made and have me remake it. And they first tried to tell me the incorrect story that it was a "" glitch '' that would resolve itself once the next statement generated. I pointed out to them the first time I made that assumption they were on the phone with me calling me and accusing me of failing to make a payment when due. Unbelievable, unacceptable, bumbling incompetence. They should have their license pulled."

495527,Credit card,"XX/XX/XXXX I 've received multiple offers for a XXXX XXXX XXXX Card with a sign-up bonus of XXXX miles after I spend {$4000.00} in the first three months of account opening. As I 've tried to apply via the XXXX website the sign-up bonus was showing as XXXX miles, so I 've called the Chase customer support number and the representative re-assured me that I 'll receive the XXXX miles, as long as I apply with his support via phone and request the miles to be credited after I meet the spending limit. I 've applied, and met the spending limit before the initial 3 months, XX/XX/XXXX. It has been over a year since I have the XXXX XXXX XXXX Card and I 've never received the advertised offer for XXXX miles, instead my account was credited only with XXXX miles. I 've kept inquiring via the Chase customer support every other week, and I 've spent at least 20 hours on the phone waiting or talking to some of their representatives and supervisors, without any success. During the initial calls the Chase representatives were re-assuring that I 'll be credited for the full amount, as I 've met the spending limit they 've started asking for a copy of the promotional letter, something that they own and should track in their marketing/advertising database, as I 've received a personalized letter on my home address. Nevertheless, during one of the follow up calls, XX/XX/XXXX, I 've shared the promotional code from the letter, and once again I was re-assured that there is a XXXX miles promotional offer associated with my profile and that it will take them another 1-2 months to credit my account. So I 've waited for another couple of weeks only to realize that Chase did n't honor their promise. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by one of the Chase customer support supervisors that since it 's been over 10 months and they have n't received a faxed/mailed copy of the offer, something that I 've shared with his team months ago, and it was acknowledged, that I 'm no longer eligible and I will not receive the full XXXX miles. I 've informed them that I 'll be raising this issue with you ( CFPB ) and I truly hope that you 'll help me and other customers by stopping these inappropriate practices before they become major issues. There should be zero tolerance for false advertising of rewards that the issuer has no intention or capability to honor. Also Chase should keep track of all personalized marketing offers, instead of playing a dumb, when it 's customers request their benefits."
613625,Bank account or service,"I responded to a promotional offer from Suntrust Bank, which promised a {$200.00} bonus for opening a select checking account and making a {$2000.00} direct deposit within 60 days. I met the requirements but did not receive the bonus. When I asked online customer service, they said I do not qualify for the promotion because I had closed my previous account at Suntrust within 180 days. This is completely different from what I was told on the phone in XX/XX/XXXX, just before I opened the current account. Back then the phone customer service told me that my previous account was closed over 6 months ago, and I would qualify for the promotion as long as I make the qualifying direct deposits within 60 days. 

I sent a detailed email to a member of the Suntrust Executive team ( copy attached ), asking them to stand by the information I was given on the phone. In response they claimed "" Our investigation was unable to find documentation showing that you were informed you would qualify for the promotion. '' I reiterated my position that the proof is in the phone conversation in XX/XX/XXXX, and requested them to review that call and award the bonus if my claim is correct, or provide me a copy/transcript of the call showing that my claim is incorrect. This should be a simple task, considering that Suntrust claims all phone calls are recorded for quality assurance ( and as I provided all my identification info for the agent to locate my prior account, it should not be that hard to locate the call. ) All correspondence attached, and pleas note each pdf file has several pages. 

Suntrust responded with an identical form letter ( even with the same date ), claiming that "" Our investigation was unable to find documentation showing that you were informed you would qualify for the promotion ''. This indicates they either made no effort to locate the phone call, or they had located the call earlier and found that it corroborates my claim. 

Please note that this is not the first time Suntrust agents have provided blatantly false information during the short time I had this account. My original email to the executive office describes another incident where Suntrsut lost my {$1000.00} deposit and gave me the runaround for over 10 days. 

It is deceptive that I was told one thing before I opened this account, and the opposite after I invested several thousands of dollars with Suntrust based on that information. Also unfair that the executive office brushed off my request with the claim "" we were unable to find documentation ... '', a statement most likely false considering they claim to record all phone calls. 

All I ask is to receive the {$200.00} bonus I was promised in return for depositing my money with Suntrust. I am also attaching a sampling of reviews/complaints from other customers who were cheated out of the similar bonuses by Suntrust, demonstrating that Suntrust makes a habit of this deceptive practice."

324787,Mortgage,"In XXXX XXXX I was asked to represent a seller in petitioning his lender - CitiMortgage to allow them to do a short sale because of a financial hardship that was created when the occupant relocated. The borrowers household budget could not support this property expenses as well as their living expenses. I received an offer on the property and have had numerous conversations with the lender including the submission of several duplicate documents which on occasion has not been uploaded so that the representatives can identify the docs. The file has been transferred a few times, XXXX appraisals done the beginning of XXXX XXXX and the value is grossly overstated. At the time the appraisals were done, the city had issued code violations that were readily available but the appraisers failed to provide the reporting of these violations which were issued XXXX XXXX. Furthermore, Citi Mortgage assigned the property to a preservation team while the property remained occupied by the tenants in XXXX XXXX. While the tenants were in the process of relocating they communicated their move out date to the rep which in turn changed the locks etc..I had to call Citi to obtain access to a property that the owner - WHO IS STILL MAINTAINING THE HOME was not aware that they entered into his home. I am currently disputing the net requirement at closing of {$58000.00} because the homes in the immediate area/and like condition does n't allow for the sales price that would net {$58000.00}. In addition the value has declined even further because of what has been done to the property that will cost additional money to restore. At the time that I listed the home ( I have photos ) the porch needed MINOR repair because of cracks near the steps however, I went to the property on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and immediately viewed the horrible cement job that was done by the preservation team. Someone replaced the stairs and attempted to patch the cracks on the porch. The homeowner is unaware of who authorized this and at the time the buyer viewed the home, this damage ( called repair ) was not present. I am quite disturb that this is directly impacting the file moving forward. Most recently I received a call the homeowner support specialist requesting additional information - I forwarded pictures, XXXX, citations from the city referencing the Occupancy Cert removal, an affidavit the city required signed by the buyer, a letter drafted by myself reflecting the quality of the home that is diminishing due to the lack of attention by the assigned preservation team and their unauthorized work performed without the appropriate permits pulled for the cement work. As of today the CitiMortgage rep failed to honor a scheduled appt to continue the discussion of the file with the goal of getting this matter settled and approved because this case has been opened since XXXX XXXX. After waiting a hour for the rep to call, I contacted Citi and was told that neither she nor her manager or team lead could be located after being left on hold for several minutes. I am concerned that the borrowers will not be given a fair and accurate consideration. The buyer has increased his offer from the initial offer in spite of over {$14000.00} in repairs the home needs. The avg home price in this area is {$55000.00} which is move in condition. This home does not meet the criteria of "" move-in '' because of repairs required by the local municipality in order to have the occupancy certification re-instated."

Instead of US BANK allowing me to make the monthly payments, US BANK began debiting each checking account for {$100.00} without my permission. When the agreement was set up over the phone I was told to make the monthly payment so I had no knowledge that payments would be debited from my account. On XXXX I transferred {$220.00} from saving account to checking account ending in XXXX. My checking account balance was approximately about {$220.00} There were no pending debits or outstanding balances from US BANK or anyone. So I went on line to pay my past due electric bill {$94.00}. of course I need lights on. so after I paid my electric bill online using my US debit card so payment can be immediately taken out, US BANK did a miscellaneous debit for XXXX to my checking account ending in XXXX which overdrew my account then charged me an another overdraft fee for my electric bill payment for XXXX? So in the last 24 - 48 hrs my checking accounts have been debited for XXXX in new overdraft fees. These overdraft fees do not include the monthly payments of XXXX US BANK is debiting out of both of my accounts monthly without my permission. I feel like I 'm being robbed. As of XXXX I have XXXX overdrawn checking accounts because of US BANK. On XXXX I transferred from checking account ending in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to check account ending in XXXX I paid XXXX for my phone bill and {$30.00} for my trash collection from account ending in XXXX. There was nothing pending and no outstanding balances. My balances were positive. On XXXX, US BANK not only debited XXXX from each checking account ending in XXXX and XXXX, on top of that I was charged a new XXXX overdraft fee and both payments for {$17.00} and {$30.00} were returned. I made these payments prior to US BANK miscellaneous debits to my checking accounts. Really I had already paid these bills before US BANK did both miscellaneous debits for XXXX to each checking account. US BANK returned my bill payments back unpaid and US BANK pay themselves and charged me more overdraft fees. So now both companies are going to charge me overdraft fees because US BANK returned payments although they were already paid in full. I already paid those XXXX bills with a debit card and the money was there and I had no outstanding balances. This is so unfair to me and this has to STOP TODAY. I have never filed a complaint against any company because I try to give them an opportunity to redeem themselves and make things right. I first called and tried to talk to managers at the XXXX XXXX Ohio branch. Also I called the department I set up the payments with and XXXX kept sending back to the other XXXX between the branch and that department. On XXXX the XXXX XXXX manager refused to refund overdraft fees even though US BANK cause checking accounts to be overdrawn. This is not the first time it was done in the past not that long ago. Now it is time to put a stop to this behavior because seems like things are out of control now."

The PCP was under the XXXX XXXX XXXX, which reportedly handles all billing correspondence between the XXXX and XXXX. 
-- - What happened : A routine wellness visit and related services were rendered by the doctor, which are fully covered with copay by the insurance plan, to which we paid the copay. The services should have been fully covered and paid out by XXXX to XXXX and the XXXX as a result. However, when the services were billed to XXXX by XXXX 's billing staff on behalf of the XXXX, an incorrect Tax ID was denoted for our XXXX. This was a clerical issue on their part which they have admitted to and apologized for multiple times. Since an incorrect Tax ID was used XXXX denied the covered services as a result. Even though XXXX XXXX was made aware that this was due to the incorrect Tax ID being used, the case was automatically forwarded to their collections department. When XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX were both informed of this oversight, Billing assured me that it had been redacted from Collections, however Collections was indifferent. 
-- - What I 've done to attempt to resolve this : Well over half a year has passed since this began, and all the while I 've been corresponding with the three parties to get this clerical issue sorted out. I have been assured by all three parties that this is of no fault of my own, and that there is absolutely nothing I can do on my end to amend their error ( as the XXXX Tax ID can not be disclosed to me, nor do I have any authority to amend the paperwork with this correct information ). 

I was assured by XXXX Billing Director XXXX every time we spoke that this would not be sent to collections, that no action was needed by my part, and that I can disregard notices being sent automatically regarding the "" amount due '' as they were working with XXXX to sort this out. He explained that he was sending my case to their "" specialist that handles cases dealing with XXXX '' and that it would be taken care of and would not hit my credit report. I had since been checking in with XXXX and XXXX periodically and been repeatedly told the same. 

One month ago I received a notice that my case was being sent to a collections agency if I did not send a Notice Of Appeal to inform XXXX and XXXX of any error. On XXXX XXXX I used certified mail to send this notice. XXXX has yet to confirm receipt. Just recently XXXX confirmed receipt and denied to pay out because the incorrect Tax ID is still being sent, and that I may request the information they have, and send it with a complaint to Illinois Department of Insurance ( I am waiting the 30 days to receive this info to do so ). 

Yesterday I received a letter from XXXX collection agency Transworld Systems INC. indicating that this has indeed been sent to collections and that it will be reported to all credit bureaus unless I pay the full amount due.

The main billing number for XXXX and/or the XXXX is XXXX. 

The PCP in question is XXXX XXXX XXXX, the direct number of the office wherein service was provided to us is XXXX ( she nolonger practices at this office, as the case is half a year old and she reportedly left due to numerous other instances of the same happening to other patients ' accounts, preventing her from receiving her payments ).

However, I was doing research into my payment history today and found that ever since then ( approximately 5 years ), my payments are inconsistently applied to interest and principal. For example, if my payments are made on time, {$0.00} of my payment is applied to the principal and all of the payment goes toward interest. Many payments are showing that {$0.00} or some other small fraction of my monthly payment has actually been going to pay off my loan.

192159,Mortgage,"Dear CFPB Representative, We signed a "" shared appreciation agreement '' with Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC who represents the note holder XXXX XXXX. In this agreement Ocwen was to, in exchange for, very high payments, forgive a substantial portion of the principal owed on their mortgage. Now comes, that after over a year of us making excruciating payments that have depleted our savings, Ocwen has pulled out of the agreement leaving us with a foreclosure, likely loss of our home, and our life savings gone. 
They claim that their employees / representatives misled us into this situation but that at the end they were canceling the agreement and moving forward with foreclosure. We have already received the foreclosure notice. 
The key provision of this agreement was the principal forgiveness. The note holder, XXXX XXXX, had us locked in what they call a "" negative amortization '' loan, where the balance of the loan actually goes up instead of down. Together with the housing crisis of 2008 we have a very severe negative equity in our home. After the government prohibited these negative amortization loans, the note holder changed us into a regular ARM in order to what they termed "" stop the bleeding ''. However the payments soon tripled in size and made things impossible. Subsequently Ocwen, now the new servicer of the loan, convinced us to sign this agreement in exchange for this principal forgiveness that would pull us back to a break even equity position. Based on that we signed. Now that the market has been improving, Ocwen has decided to pull out. In our opinion they have done so in order to bring in more cash for themselves from a foreclosure rather than having to comply with the principal forgiveness agreement they signed with us. They are covering their tracks by removing long time representatives from our account, bringing in bogus "" customer advocate reps '', erasing electronic correspondence within our account at their website etc. 

We find this to be negligent and outrageous. We have been sent into financial disaster by Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC and the note holder XXXX XXXX.

543414,Credit card,"Wells Fargo Home XXXX XXXX Credit Card Program payment calculation is deceptive beyond belief ( it is so complicated it is hard to explain it all ). We used their charge card in XXXX for windows at 0 % for 60 months no interest if paid off after 60 months. The payment was divided among 60 months. In XXXX we added a charge for Blinds that was 0 % for 12 months. What they did not explain is how the payment was calculated for the XXXX different terms. We paid every payment for every charge on time until the last charge. We did not realize that the term was slightly different for the 12 month term. The 12 month "" special rate deal amount was deferred interest, Wells Fargo only billing the minimum payment not dividing into XXXX equal payments which we would have paid off after 12 months. Instead the charge ( minimum pmt ) was combined with the 60 month term, but the statement did not show what was getting paid, as it is not separated on the bill. After 12 months it was n't paid due to misunderstanding the terms, therefore we were charged the entire year of astronomically high interest. Not only did it leave a larger balance than anticipated, but the payoff for the 12 month term was only giving the amount for that charge and did n't add in the payment for the 60 months. The interest rate immediately jumped from XXXX ( as if that is n't high enough - since our credit score is in the XXXX range ) to the 28.24 % If we had realized and paid the entire amount, we would then be short for the 60 month term because that amount is listed in small print in a separate sentence, so technically we 'd be in default on XXXX payments. The online payment option makes this very easy to overlook because you need to open the statement to realize that the Special Terms balance is due. The charge was put in my name, but my husband was paying the bills. You need a computer accounting program to figure out how the Wells Fargo bills the charges. Wells Fargo said it was up to the merchant to explain the credit card terms. We always make our payments on time and we even got caught on this XXXX.

I authorized them to take the money out of my account automatically by giving them my account and routing number.

Suddenly, 7 or 8 months later, I received a letter from an attorney saying the account was charged off and placed with them for collection. I called Discover and nobody could explain what had happened, until finally I got a hold of a manager who said the account was charged off on the same day that I was put on the payment plan and that the representative should not have put me on a payment plan. They said they called back to advise me of that but I never received the call. I assumed everything was settled since the money was being taken out of my account each month. Discover now claims that I was mailing in checks but no, the money was taken out of my account through whatever authorization I gave the representative over the phone when the agreement was made. Discover says that now that the account has been referred to an attorney there is nothing they can do about it. I do n't understand how the company can simply say that it made a mistake and should never have entered into an agreement and how it can choose to cancel that agreement without informing me of its decision and while taking payments from my account. At this point, I do n't even know if the payments were credited or not."

We never gave the keys to the bank because we were told that there may be programs that could help us save our house. We were denied for a couple of months until after XXXX XXXX XXXX we were offered a XXXX Modification. 
We then went through a series of 3 month trial payments that took 2 years to finally complete. XXXX of the things that the modification required was that we showed proof that our 2nd Mortgage was removed. IndyMac had our XXXX at the time and we had a balance of {$190000.00}. Thy sent a XXXX showing that the debt was charged off. This was enough to satisfy the modification and we were approved. 
Now we wanted to sell our house pay off the debt we currently have and relocate with a fresh start. Our house was in escrow when the title company discovered that IndyMac never removed their lien. This was a complete shock as it never showed on any of our credit reports and we were never sent anything in the mail and never received a single phone call. Even they said that it should be easy to get them to release the lien because they already sent the XXXX. 
I called CIT which bought IndyMac and they originally said that it should be all taken care of. Then they said they sent the XXXX in error. Then they back tracked and said it was n't an error and that I do owe them, unless I have a XXXX modification which should protect me and they could give me a lien release if I could show that it was a "" performing '' XXXX which means that I have been paying and it is current ( which it is ). I sent them the loan paperwork and payment history. They said that should be enough and would send it in for review and we should have it all taken care of. Instead they called back the next day telling me that the pool of investors that my modification is in will not release the lien. All of the other pools of investors will release liens just not the one that I happen to be in. This is crazy and does not make any sense. I need to have this lien released so I can move forward with my life. If it is n't I am facing another bankruptcy because I can not sell my home with this lien ( it would have to be a short sale ). IndyMac got bailed out so technically they already got paid. Can you help me get this lien of my title so I can sell??"
671628,Debt collection,"I received first correspondence around XX/XX/2016 for an alleged debt for XXXX. I immediately responded and disputed the debt as well as requested "" validation '' or proof of alleged debt. A week or so after I received a blank invoice from collection agency holding supposed "" debt '' with a total balance due - No line items or explanation of what the amount due was for. I then responded requesting evidence of debt rather than a blank invoice with no line items or proof of debt. The representative assured me that this "" debt '' would not be reported to the credit bureaus until I received some sort of validation explaining services rendered or detailing what charges occurred for me to be responsible for this debt. 

I received no further correspondence until I learned that this company has since reported this "" debt '' against my credit and my score has since dropped XXXX points. I then called yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX requesting explanation of this behavior and why I was not contacted with further proof of supposed debt. I was quickly transferred to their collections floor manager ( XXXX ) who could not explain why they had illegally reported against my credit and seemed to not be interested in answering any of my questions. He seemed to have a tenuous grasp of his credit reporting procedures and instead of answering my simple questions he decided to call my questions "" contradictory ''. He curtly advised that I call another department for explanation of this. I believe he knew his agency was in the wrong because he kept trying to push me off of the phone. When I finally asked him point blank if he has the power to delete credit accounts that have already been reported he abruptly hung up on me, which I obviously found to be very rude, instead of attempting to help me in any way. Or explain in any degree of detail why I had not received any proof of debt. They should have not reported this supposed debt while it was under dispute. 

All calls are claimed to be recorded and I have responded quickly to any attempt to collect this "" supposed '' debt. I am contemplating retaining legal council to deal with this problem because the agency in question seems to not want to adhere to the strict laws that protect consumers like me. This process has caused me a great deal of stress and mental anguish as well as affected my otherwise impeccable credit record. I feel like I have exhausted all avenues that are available to me as a consumer and this is my last effort before retaining legal council.

Essentially, I will be forced to pay the AmEx membership, even though I wo n't use it due to lack of benefits just so I can maintain my credit rating. These types of "" partnerships '' between retailers -- a "" wholesaler '' in this case -- and credit card companies seem to force people into situations that are n't fair.

From the enclosed statement you can see that was not the case. In fact almost 2 years of payments show no principal reduction at all. As you go over the statement you find many inconsistencies. Such as we have made the XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. The principal on the statement said {$250.00}, yet we were credited {$120.00}. We were credited {$170.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and then {$140.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Why would it be less? Why would it be less again on the next payment? I called TCF on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX my time.I spoke with XXXX and she had no explanation. The called last 26 minutes and she acted like I did n't know what I was talking about.

I received the loan modification agreement, signed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and was XXXX back to you by the XXXX envelope the lender provided, however, as I spoke to XXXX XXXX, she told me advised me that somehow the modification was denied because the document was altered. Also, my previous attorney was in contact with Seterus until XXXX of XXXX regarding the final report from the court. My case was discharged but I still had outstanding balance to pay to trustee and the last payment was made in XXXX of XXXX. 
As I agreed with Seterus with loan modification, I have been paying {$2700.00} since XXXX of XXXX until XXXX of XXXX totaling {$62000.00}. I believe I have done all I can to cooperate and took my part of the loan modification to make sure all he payment went in on time. 
I have contacted the servitor in XXXX of XXXX, trying to find out what the payoff is, this is when one of the representative advised me that my property is in default and in the process of foreclosure. Nobody from Seterus has contacted me to advise me that my account is in default or in foreclosure status for XXXX month!, NOT EVEN ONCE!!! 
After I contacted them, now they decided and sending all these letters, I have been receiving all these letters about reinstatement fee, late fee, penalty, etc etc. Noone has bother to call me or send me a simple letter stating the fact and now they are going crazy sending me these letters to get more money out of me. 
I requested to investigate my account from the date I requested the modification, which was in XXXX XXXX, until now for the open balance as well as approve my loan modification as I signed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Nothing, no investigation was done. 
I have received letter from you dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX regarding the reinstatement fee in the total amount of {$40000.00}. I have applied for loan modification program on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and I have spoken to the representative name XXXX XXXX XXXX and she advised me that my application is in the process of reviewing and in the waiting period. 
I have received another letter from you dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, notice of default due to the non-payment in the amount of {$34000.00}. 
I have sent the letter to your department requesting how the amount of {$40000.00} has accumulated and also, detailed explanation of open balance in the amount of {$34000.00}. However, as of this date, nothing has been received, but you are sending me all these letters. I need some explanation of the open balance. I need to know which amount is right amount. 
As I stated, many representatives from the company that I have been approved for loan modification in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and from their end, it has not been finalized. However, on my end, I have been making {$2700.00} for the past 23 months totaling {$62000.00}. 
I need to know the followings : 1. {$2700.00} since XXXX through XXXX, totaling 23 months = {$62000.00} ; 2. {$2900.00} since XXXX through XXXX, totaling 23 months = {$67000.00} ; 3. Difference from XXXX to XXXX = {$5100.00} ; 4. So basically there is {$5100.00} difference and obviously you will put late fee and along with other fee would be added, but having {$40000.00} open balance is not understandable. 
I requested to send me the explanation where the money I paid to you for the past 23 months and where they were applied and even if I made those payments, how come there is an open balance of over {$40000.00}. Nothing was answered. No letter explanation about the fund applied just calling me to verifying information over 100 times. 
Now, they are requesting me to sign new loan modification agreement with 40 years, trying get more interest money from me plus more. 
Their website is stating that they are there to help but in my opinion, they are taking advantage of people like me who is having hard time paying the bill"

762809,Mortgage,"I took a traditional fixed morgage with Capital one in about XXXX of XXXX when my income was about XXXX to XXXX a year.The same year I lost my job. I liquidated my retire plan to catch up on mortgage and other expenses. I eventually found a job with The state of Florida where I make only about XXXX a year. As a result of a drastic change in income I fell behind my mortgage for about 2 months. I have been making at least one full payment each month since I fell behind. I started a loan modification process about XXXX to 4 months a go in XXXX or XXXX XXXX. I submitted initial documents requested. I was asked to submit additional documents which I did. The main issue is, capital one is intentionally delaying the process to force me into foreclosure because I strongly believe the company is in to make gains and not care about my plight at all. The ask for my monthly pay stub, I send it, they sit on the document, until a new pay period then they send a nasty letter that if I do not send a new paystub my case will be closed. I did that about 3 times. The other part is, they requested my insurance declaration page, which I sent, it was confirmed they have it, now they are asking for the same document-I thought my information or documents were to be kept securely. I requested so many times for the case worker to call me back but she would not. When I asked for corporate number there is none. 
To add salts to injury, Capital one sat on my application for about three months when I was told underwriter reviewed my application and I needed this document and that document only to submit all required documents and then being told a box on my application was not checked. My question is if a box was not checked, why did they not send me back the document for me to check what is needed but rather waited until I submitted all required documents to send me a letter I received on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX asking me to check a box on a page but they did not bother to include the document I needed to check of. To prove how eager ( it seems someone makes personal gains when a XXXX is pushed through foreclosure especially if the how value has almost doubled like mine ) capital one 360 home loan is to foreclose my house, I was given 4 days from the time I receive the letter to check off a box on a form that was not included in the envelope and return or else I will not be able to stop foreclosure once a foreclosure sale date is set. 
Why should capital one 360 keep asking for the same documents I sent, some I sent so many times then threaten foreclosure due to their in ability to send me a form they sat on with their underwriters for about three months, then sending threatening foreclosure letter asking me to check a box on a ducument they did not include in the envelope. Could Capital One 360 Home loans not have sent this document along with all the several request they made on my pay stubs for me to complete right from the onset? This is a deliberate attempt. I read so many comments online about frustration borrowers go through with Capital one 360 home loans and I am a living witness."

I made several other calls and spoke to supervisors who promised to close the account and make the transfer but never followed up.I called again on XXXX XXXX, spoke with a supervisor XXXX XXXX, who apologized, said he was not like the other supervisors, and ensured me the transfer would take place. Like the other Supervisors he did not follow up. 
Here we are nine days later. I spoke with a representative who said his name is XXXX. I asked to speak with XXXX XXXX. XXXX put me on hold. He returned and advised me the TDA had rolled over and I had to go into the Bank. I told it, it was not my fault since I had been calling since XXXX XXXX, 2015. He then said as POA, I could not request the telephone transfer even though the funds were going into an account with the same title. I told him none of the many representatives, and supervisors I spoke with gave me this information, and asked him why XXXX TDA was closed, and transferred. He said it was a mistake. I stated that the supervisors needed to be retrained, and at this point my request should be accommodated. XXXX agreed with the retraining, but did not agree to accommodate my request. As of XXXX/XXXX/15, I have not gotten any results. 




I would like to have this account closed, and transferred to the savings account with all accrued interest included. All supervisor and representatives should ask themselves, how They would feel if this happened to them. I think they would agree this is horrible, unacceptable service. 




Thank You, XXXX XXXX POA, For XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"

637809,Mortgage,"I write to seek assistance in addressing what amounts to at best a flawed credit reporting system and at worst unethical business practice by Chase Home Mortgage. In short, when I divorced, I was awarded a rental property jointly titled to me and my ex-wife, XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ; I was unable to refinance the property and had to short sell it. Chase conceded to sell short the home ( rightly ) without the use of any financial data from my ex-wife, including closing the sale without her signature, and yet nonetheless penalized her credit as a result of this short sale. This practice is wrong and unfair. It effectively allows lenders to honor divorce decrees for purposes of assessing short sale viability while disregarding terms of divorce decrees for the purpose of credit reporting. Further, in the case of Chase, it belies Chase 's conflicting and repeated promises throughout the short sale process to remove my ex-wife from the note. 

I was divorced XX/XX/XXXX and incurred a sizable debt and reduced income as a result. In the process, my credit took a severe hit and I was awarded a home that was worth slightly more than half of what was owed on the home. With poor credit and lacking the capital required to refinance, I was left to list the home for an expected short sale XX/XX/XXXX. In this initial listing, Chase refused to consider a short sale because I was current on my payments, so in consultation with my realtor, I skipped one payment XX/XX/XXXX for the preceding month and the home was re-listed thereafter. 

During this process, I was represented by XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX, a veteran of over XXXX short sales. In the first listing of the home, we understood that my ex-wife could be removed from the note with a refinance. However, I could not qualify for such refinancing and any loan modification would not have been sufficient for me to afford the payments with my income slashed, a renter in default and the property needing repair. Upon the second listing of the home, we were first told by Chase that my ex-wife could not be removed from the note since it was then in default. As the process deepened, and financial documents were being solicited of me -- and not of my ex-wife -- we were told by XXXX at Chase that Chase would in fact ensure her credit would not be affected negatively since they were only using my financial information to assess the short sale. When the underwriters finally approved the short sale, we were then told that the indemnification of my ex-wife would have to happen "" further down the process. '' XXXX was also removed from the case at that time. It should be noted herein that my ex-wife requested repeatedly to be updated by Chase and was told she could not be since it was my financial data that was being used to process the short sale. Prior to closing the sale, Chase 's final position on the matter was that it would be easier to have the negative reporting removed from my ex-wife 's credit bureaus after the sale closed. Upon closing, my ex-wife has been stonewalled by Chase and has reached out to numerous outlets to underscore not only the convoluted and unfair logic at work herein, but the underhanded manner in which Chase made assurances while only my data was being used and then backed off of them once the sale cleared underwriting. 

In short, Chase honored our divorce decree for the purposes of assessing my qualifications for a short sale of this property ; during this time, they assured us that negative reporting to my wife 's credit status would be rectified. Once approved for the short sale, their representation to us, and their story, changed. The house closed without her signature and with her still on title and Chase has refused to amend their negative reporting on her credit score."

Both XXXX XXXX and Equifax were reporting it as 120 days late but Equifax was showing a balance due. I filed a dispute with both Reporting Agencies, XXXX XXXX removed it from my report after a week. Equifax did NOT remove it, they left it on my report only removing the Balance Due. When I contacted Equifax regarding this mistake they proceeded to tell me I had to file another Dispute which would take another 30 days. I contacted XXXX Loans again and they confirmed again it should n't be on my report as the Mortgage was given back to XXXX. Equifax is also not updating their system regarding my credit scores, they show a vastly different amounts owed and score than what XXXX XXXX is reporting my credit scores. Equifax reports my credit score as XXXX yet XXXX XXXX shows it as XXXX with vastly different amounts of what I have opened and owed to my current creditors.

606971,Credit card,"I called the hotel, XXXX XXXX, possibly XX/XX/XXXX, to reserve a block of rooms for my son 's soccer team who was playing in a tournament in XXXX, MT on XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/2016. They gave me a block of XXXX non-smoking, double rooms for $ XXXX/night plus tax. The rate of the room was {$82.00} per night. When I made the reservation, they did ask for my credit card to "" hold '' the rooms. In addition, we agreed that any unused/reserved rooms would be released on Friday, XX/XX/2016. I asked a couple of different times before hanging up with them that the unused rooms would be released so that they would be able to have them available for other customers. There was nothing in writing confirming this, only verbally from the clerk who took my reservation. 
I checked in to the XXXX XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/2016 for check out on Sunday, XX/XX/2016. At that time, the front desk clerks did not mention anything to me about possibly charging me for the unreserved rooms. In fact, nothing was mentioned about the unreserved rooms at that time. I paid for my room, XXXX, for the two nights for a total cost of {$160.00}. 
When I got back to the hotel after XXXX on Saturday, XX/XX/2016, a hotel clerk asked me if anyone has talked to me about the unreserved rooms and being charged for those unreserved rooms. I told her at the time that I was told XX/XX/XXXX, that any rooms not reserved by Friday, XX/XX/2016 were to be released. She said that she would talk to her manager and get back to me that night. No one contacted me for the rest of the night. 
When I was checking out Sunday, XX/XX/2016 no one said anything to me about charging me for the XXXX unreserved rooms. I believed that the issue was resolved and that the rooms that they wanted to charge me for were then used for the night of XX/XX/2016. 
The documentation that is listed under Case # XXXX is the amount that I agreed to pay in the amount of {$160.00} and you have the same copy I have for the receipt, registrations, and bill given to me when I checked in on Friday, XX/XX/2016 at XXXX. However, under the same case number, there is an additional charge for {$82.00} which I did not give permission to charge my credit card for that amount. 
When I further look at the documentation sent regarding this matter, the XXXX XXXX is using the credit card slip I did sign for in the amount of {$160.00} for room XXXX for the additional rooms. I did not give them permission to use the credit card for the other rooms. 
I have documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX that the hotel gave to XXXX XXXX XXXX in where bills for various rooms that were unused by myself, but there are no signatures giving my consent to use my credit card for those other rooms. How am I able to send that additional documentation to you for review?"

At this point we are very confused as to exactly why we were denied. This is very unfair and we are probably going to end up losing our house because of this.

I wanted to give my kids the option to begin credit and finance education early, so I called Capital One and asked them if they have a program to add my kids to my account as authorized users to have their own cards to use at school or when they go out. They welcomed the idea and told me that they certainly allow that and were eager to collect my kids information including the dates of birth, SSN, and names. Then they told me that the cards will arrive shortly. a few days later Capital One restricted access to my card. I was treated with total unprofessional way to say the least and was accused with fraud, insulted, and the representative hung up the phone on me. I called again and a manager was very nice and apologized and informed me that I need to send copies of my kids IDs and SSN, and I did. The next day I found out that the earlier representative had actually closed my account without my consent and without reading me the required disclosure and had done so after he actually hung up the phone with me based on the time stamp of the call log which he should not have been authoirzed to continue accessing the account after he terminated the call. I called the following day and spoke with fraud account manager "" XXXX '' who apologized and confirmed that the representative closed the account after he hung up the phone with me and he should have read me the required disclosure.

I called today when she did not honor her promise to call only to find out that they closed the second account completely as well. when asking about the reasons, they said we could do so if we want to at our discretion. I expressed that I have not done anything wrong as I called and asked Capital One before making any account changes and they were the ones that added the authorized users and then closed my accounts which were maintained in good standing the whole time to the extent that they increased my limits automatically several times from {$300.00} to {$5300.00} which would never have been the case if the accounts were poorly managed and there should have been no justification for the way these accounts have been closed."

We have reached out to Wells Fargo MANY times and they are ignoring us and continue to recuse themselves from having to abide by laws ( that i hope you enforce ). They will not tell us which branch it was cashed at so we can get a search warranty from the detective we are working with. We are VERY upset that a BIG bank thinks they are above the law and we are NEVER going to accept that answer. Wells Fargo is the bank that made us aware that we are victims of fraud and then disappeared. They also initially reimbursed us for our lost money ( due to a KNOWN false, illegal, not cool, dishonest, check ) and then took back the money and claimed they were innocent and never even cashed the check ( which they actually told the detective that ). I promise you that every institution we contact about this situation will be held to doing their job. We are NOT going away!

When Nationstar assumed this loan ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) they rejected my usual payment which I make through an automatic schedule with my internet bill paying service. I was unaware that Nationstar had rejected my regular payment until I received a collection call.

I knew that was not true so I asked to be transferred to the Insurance Department whom I informed that I did not wish insurance beyond that required by my contract. I was not named as Insured when Nationstar assumed this loan, why it decided to make that unilateral change is a mystery ( unless there is a profit in it for Nationstar ). 

Despite two more phone calls to protest and promises that the monthly billing would be adjusted to reflect the change, Nationstar has continued to bill me for insurance that I did not request and to which I did not consent. If I do not include the additional {$260.00} per month with my regular payment, Nationstar will not post my payment. This is extortion."

Since I had made a return with the same merchant, the merchant had issued a credit for that transaction. The actual disputed transaction has no relation to this credit. 
Since I disputed the transaction through the credit card, the credit card issued a credit, but when investigated, the credit card company ran into a credit that has nothing to do with the disputed transaction. This transaction has different times and reference number etc, the merchant took the position that since the merchant has issued a credit, even though a different amount, product, time, reference etc, the credit card company rebill be the credit as a charge on my account for {$67.00}. 
The credit card has not released the money to the merchant nor to the consumer but put it in their pocket where it does not belong. 
The money must be returned to merchant and given proof to consumer to follow up with merchant or return to the consumer. thanks I have called a few times but all invain."

I have asked them for information related to when my loan entered the XXXX XXXX XXXX Trust and if they are able to locate my loan in the specific pool that XXXX XXXX claims it is in ( pool # XXXX ). In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX executed an assignment naming EMC Mortgage Corp. as beneficiary. However, EMC Mortgage Corp. claimed they never had interest and never were a beneficiary. Now XXXX XXXX claims that XXXX XXXX is the beneficiary for the XXXX XXXX XXXX Trust. Under XXXX XXXX XXXX Trustee for a trust can not be a beneficiary. After EMCs and XXXX XXXX admittance in court that they were never the beneficiary, XXXX XXXX did another assignment for EMC Mortgage Corp as their attorney in fact, making an assignment to XXXX XXXX as Beneficiary for the XXXX XXXX XXXX Trust. ( EMC Mortgage Corp. has been non existent for years before this new assignment made by XXXX XXXX as attorney in fact for EMC ). I have been given anything and everything but the truth and the entities I am dealing with only know how to re-create and/or fabricate documents to make their story appear legitimate. Through their deceptive doings, I have been railroaded in all directions in dealing with the true party of interest and going to face to face meetings under the foreclosure statutes in my state. Monies I paid into the court registry faithfully were returned to me due to false entities appearing as the beneficiary. I have paid approx. $ 200K direct to XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. The majority of those funds paid were after my Chapter XXXX BK in XX/XX/XXXX where I was no longer a legal obligor, as the loan was never re-affirmed. In good faith I paid approx. $ 150K direct to XXXX XXXX after my BK discharge. I want to know what XXXX XXXX did with those payments as they claim they sold the loan on the secondary market in XX/XX/XXXX. I have never had any other statements or notifications from any other entity but XXXX XXXX. My call is coming to an end. XXXX took my call and put me on hold and talked to the higher ups he said and they are not able to find my loan anywhere tied to the trust. That is the answer I just received! Why is this so difficult? Is it because the note and DOT are no longer the security instruments and they have been converted to pass thru certificates earning money on the inside and then the note and mortgage remain on the outside? Something once again just does not add up. It never has. Thank you."
615100,Credit card,"I signed up for the American Express Platinum card on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a welcome offer for XXXX membership rewards ( MR ) points after spending {$3000.00} within 3 months. During the 3 month period I spent {$3500.00} on my card and had a return for {$34.00} and credit from American Express for {$230.00} from their Amex Offers ( {$30.00} ) and the airline incidental benefit from the card ( {$200.00} ). American Express has set a precedent and has counted the airline benefit and offers as a payment and included that into their spend calculations in the past but even without counting that amount my total spend was {$3200.00} during the promotional period. Everything has been paid on time and I currently have a zero balance. I was awarded the XXXX points on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX once I had reached the {$3000.00} in spend with my card. I tried to make a transfer to an airline and it was blocked with an error code. I called American Express and they informed me that they are reviewing the account and it should be resolved within 6-8 weeks. 

It is now XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, 8 weeks after receiving the MR points in my account, and they are still frozen/blocked. I was told their review should be completed by now and when I called again this week they said it could take up to 10 weeks. The terms of their offer state : "" Points will be credited to your Membership Rewards account within 6-8 weeks after charges appear on your monthly billing statement. '' So I have been told 6-8 weeks and their terms state that I should have them within 6-8 weeks and yet I do not have them available to me. I find this in breach of the agreement we made when I applied for the card. 

I did some research online looking into why these points have been frozen and found out that there are a lot of other Platinum Card holders that have had the same issue. I am not sure if American Express overextended itself or what the issue is but I think that they have broken the terms of their offer and I would like my points released so that I can use them. I have been a customer with American Express since XX/XX/XXXX and this is my first membership rewards card and I am pretty disappointed in the treatment that I have received. I would think they would offer better service to the customers of their premium card with a {$450.00} annual fee."

440433,Credit card,"I am writing both in general, to suggest a new consumer protection, and specifically to complain about a company called XXXX ; please forward this email to the appropriate office for possible further action against XXXX. Years ago, I agreed to a recurring charge in order to watch their video products. For over a year, I have been trying through every means possible to cancel the recurring charges on my credit card. I have repeatedly used their online forms and followed the steps listed on their website, to no avail. I tried calling the company ( finding the number was a research feat in itself ), and further got no action. I have repeatedly contacted the credit card company to cancel the charges, and I think the current options for this situation are too limited. Because the charge is so small, generally the credit card company credits my account and essentially pays the bill themselves. I need to do this each month. I was told that XXXX might even find me after getting a new credit card through the same bank, and resume charging me on the new card. It 's incredibly frustrating that my only option seems to be to repeatedly contest the charge each month, with the result that my credit card company rather than myself pays these thieves. 

I think this situation is very common, and I believe new laws and policies need to be pyut in place to help consumers and to make it impossible for this egregious behavior on the part of companies to continue. It should be possible for consumers to permanently remove recurring charges from their credit cards, without the consent of the company involved. This would shift the burden of re-establishing a financial relationship to where it belongs : back to the company that made it impossible to cancel recurring charges. I write to urge you to make this happen. Companies like XXXX should not be able to succeed in garnering money from recurring charges when they make it impossible for consumers to cancel the charges."

The first time, they applied extra principal I added to my monthly payment to interest. I tried to resolve this by phone which supposedly would take a few days. When I logged on to my account a few days later on XXXX, I noticed Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing postdated my extra mortgage payment nearly a month ( from XXXX to XXXX ) and unfairly took an extra month 's interest once again. I noticed this by checking my payoff amount, reduced by more than extra month 's interest ( see attached documents ). Mortgage companies must ensure that they are able to apply principal payments correctly and timely so consumers are not forced to pay interest not due, in my case, paying two months of interest in one month. Does Shellpoint have the ability to fix this issue in accordance with fair lending practices, compliant at the state and federal levels?

I asked them to be sure they had the most recent tax values prior to closing and they assured me the settlement company would research that for me. I found the bills posted on the county and city websites so assumed the settlement company would have no problem getting the information from the treasurer 's office directly.

I supplied a receipt and they rescheduled they called back a day later to reschedule the closing claiming they had verified the payment. My husband and I reviewed the tax numbers and saw they were in fact higher than the year before as expected so we felt Quicken had done their due diligence and gotten the updated tax bills so we signed the closing documents. Two days later Quicken called and said a special assessment had posted to our account and the taxes were going to be higher and in order to finish the closing Quicken needed an additional {$1100.00}.

733793,Mortgage,"XXXXCFPCComplaint SubmissionRe : Chase Bank/XXXX XXXXDear CFPB, I believe that this will be an unusual complaint ; however, in reviewing this document hopefully you will determine my unfortunate situation warrants contacting CFPB. 

First let me share that I am not in a foreclose situation and my wife and I have over an XXXX credit rating. 

Unfortunately, I have been diagnosed with XXXX ( XXXX ) and full time employment is no longer an option. I am the sole income provider. 

Realizing this diagnosis, I have taken a pro-active approach contacting all major creditors and sharing this information. 

My only request is time and mortgage assistance allowing me re-evaluate my financial future. 

In contacting XXXX, one of my major creditors and explaining my situation, they were extremely appreciative of me taking a financially responsible approach. 

XXXX discovered they had no programs in place to assist responsible clients in which a life altering event has occurred. The only assistance that could be provided is to force a foreclosure and then they could assist. 

XXXX 's executive management was contacted and they realized it ludicrous to force a valuable client into foreclosure in order to assist. Within 15 days, they had created a plan to assist in which was mutual agreeable. An 18 month period was granted for a dramatically reduced monthly obligation. 

In contacting Chase Bank, it was my erroneous assumption that they would follow suite since we have been a stellar client for years. 

My wife and I went through the cumbersome Chase Mortgage Assistance application only to be subject to numerous times supplying repetitive requests for information in which they already had received. 

In escalating this, I spoke with XXXX different supervisors each stating that this is a very common complaint and executive management had been notified of this broken process but little action had been taken. 

My application was declined stating that due to their guidelines, I was not a candidate. In reviewing their reasoning, I found numerous errors and available options were not even explored. 

I appealed the decision and am currently waiting for an answer. In speaking with an appeal representative, he shared that more than likely, an appeal will not be granted. 

It is my opinion that Chase Bank and XXXX XXXX ( who owns the mortgage ) are similar to XXXX Bank in not offering a program for unfortunate situations like mine. 

There is "" no risk '' to Chase Bank/XXXX. If I can not improve my financial situation within an 18 month period of time, we will sell our home and pay off all creditors with the equity in our home. 

All I am requesting is a reasonable amount time and a reduction of monthly payment obligations to Chase Bank to improve my financial landscape by exploring numerous part time employment opportunities. I will know if this plan will be successful within the requested 18 month time period. 

In researching XXXX XXXX mortgage assistance programs, I found that programs do exist, however, not quite specific to my XXXX situation. 

Attached in this complaint are copies of information provided to Chase Bank offering to share all medical records and the financially responsible steps we have taken to insure monthly obligations are met. 

I feel that a conversation with CFPC is warranted to further explain all the frustration we have experienced. 

I await your reply. 

Thank you in advance, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX"

114156,Mortgage,"Here I am complaining against the unfair experience from its home Mortgage in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in XXXX Arizona. 

I started the application from XXXX XXXX, with the trust for the best service from the XXXX. XXXX Mortgage bank in the country. Finally, it was the worst decision I have ever made in my life. 

The team rejected the application for the commitment in the first place just because the underwriter ignored my visa in the file. Now looking back, I shall have abandoned Wells Fargo at that moment. 

I found out reason, and ask the team to fix the mistake. Finally, commitment was issued. Shall I blame myself since I lost the commitment contingency? 

The real nightmare started from that moment. The underwriter kept asking for new stuff on the daily basis. I tried my best to cooperate and handed over the files mostly in 2 hours. But their process was so low that the seller had to grant me the extension for three times. The whole underwriting procedure was endless, with new request popped up again and again. No one gave me the firm answer about when the final approval shall be cleared, but only told me it should be good. 

On last Friday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX days behind the date of Essence, WF gave me nothing but a deny, without any reason except the number to the Customer Care XXXX XXXX. 

With the hope to change your decision, because I believe my file is stronger than most of your applicant, I dialed the number to find out the reason. I was hoping there shall be some professional staff finally reward me the justice. But after 10 hours, what I got is only two words "" Unacceptable Assets ''. No further details. The fellow there performed like a recorder and only can tell me "" I do n't know '' and "" I can not ''. 

I felt I have been discriminated by Wells Fargo. And such unfairness has put my deal and deposit under the risk. I am suffering the financially loss and waste of my time. I will not touch Wells Fargo anymore, for both personal issue, and work purpose. I will tell everyone to get away from Wells Fargo by all means."

642333,Credit reporting,"n addition to writing you, I have also contacted my US congressman and senators. I am writing you to discuss a problem that is plaguing many tax payers that are in debt to the IRS. Even though many consumers resolved their tax debt with the IRS, credit reporting agencies are allowed to come in and report information on a credit report without verifying anything about the debt with the IRS. The IRS does not even report to the credit bureaus so these agencies are out seeking information to place on consumer reports without any regard for how this information is negatively impacting consumers. Those of us that went to law school, medical school and other professions are carrying an incredible tax burden. It is hard to encourage our children to stay in school or to see them incur debt like we did when we know that they will be expected to carry the burden and will not be entitled to many tax breaks that are provided to those who make less ( student loan deduction ) or countless deductions for XXXX and XXXX. We have person running for president who does not even pay taxes which shocks the conscious of when the burden is on the back of the taxpayers around or above that {$250000.00} threshold that is deemed "" wealthy ''. There is nothing wealthy about that tax bracket at all as we are barely able to meet the monthly expenses and provide opportunities for our children. I am a trial attorney and unfortunately in 2014 had a bad year. In addition, I had truly bad advice from my accountant which led to me and my husband owing over {$80000.00} to the IRS. AT that time we owed much smaller amounts on the years before but were paying that debt. I have had a payment plan with the IRS for a year now and have never defaulted on my installment agreement. This year, I was able to pay my taxes in full and it was looking like we may be moving ahead. We have XXXX boys at home and were looking forward to buying a home after we lost ours during the crash. We have worked hard to pay off our debts and rebuild our credit. Although I had been paying the IRS, I was going to take a line of credit ( since my score had improved ) that would have paid the tax lien off and enabled us to buy a home. In the month before doing so, the credit bureaus combed the court records and reported the original amount of the lien on my credit report. This prevents me from borrowing anything- a credit line or a home. The credit bureaus are allowed to go in and report what they find at the court house without any regard for the amount actually owed and they do not report whether a tax payer is making their monthly payments. This information stays on a credit report for 7 more years after the lien is paid. Ironically, the IRS does not even report this information to the credit bureaus, the bureaus seek it out so that they can profit by obtaining inquiries. This is truly detrimental to the taxpayer. First of all, it discourages the taxpayer that is more than willing to pay their obligation and gives a false picture of a person 's credit. I completely understand the reporting if a ) the amount reported is correct at the time of reporting or 2 ) if the taxpayer is not paying at all on their debt. Why does a private agency have this much power to cripple consumers that are trying to recover in this economy? I have also written our lawmakers and urged our leaders to consider legislation that will encourage taxpayers to pay their debts but also acknowledge that we have to be able to live and support our families. Private credit bureaus should have some responsibility to accurately report lien information and should not be able to report without verification of whether or not a taxpayer is actually paying their debt.

We had already moved to a larger house and I was trying to sell the older, smaller home when I was laid off. I fell behind on the payments. The Bank was not happy, but I worked out an agreement to catch up the payments, ( borrowed money from family ) and the Bank sent me a letter. That letter said I had to catch up the past due payments in full by XXXX XXXX, 1992 for {$2700.00}, which I did. I have the letter and the Bank receipt. I soon found a job and I put the house up for rent as started making the regular payments again the very next month. 
Well, what I did not know at the time, was that the Bank, XXXX, had been acquired by XXXX XXXX, later to become Wachovia, and then Wells Fargo. Whoever it was, they refused to acknowledge the written agreement set forth in the letter that they sent, returned my check and started foreclosure. I had a significant amount of equity in this property and for whatever reason, they continued with the sale of the property on the steps of the XXXX County Courthouse. When I got advanced notice by certified letter, that forced me into a Bankruptcy. Well, that did n't stop them. They sold the property on the County Courthouse steps anyway. And too bad for them that Federal law trumps State law, they had to reverse that sale. It was ugly. 
The Bank was not happy. I was now dealing with XXXX XXXX, one of the biggest Banks in the country and they were extremely hostile. When I came out of my Chapter XXXX payment plan 3 years later, they went right back to their old ways and refused to make a proper accounting of my loan balance. They could n't. They had lost control some how. They refused to acknowledge the correct balance. Enter my second Chapter within months of my first Chapter being discharged. That too has been discharged. I pay my debts if given a chance. 
In my view, I had a written agreement with the Bank to bring my payments up to date. I met the terms of that written agreement. I still have those documents. I can not begin to explain the problems this has caused for me and my family. I believe it was a fraud and an attempt to make a quick sale of my property because it had a significant amount of equity. Because I was forced into XXXX Bankruptcies, this has cost not only time and money but also in my ability to gain adequate employment.

As of today XX/XX/XXXX I am still showing a balance of over XXXX dollars. Never missed a payment. They representative stated that any late payments are added to the interest of the loan at XXXX for each day late. Even if this were the case I would 've had to accrue over 365 days late to reflect the current balance which is impossible since I 've only had the car a little over a year. Then I was told my loan total was XXXX which is a complete lie and if it were true that means I would 've paid XXXX dollars within the last year which is also false information according to the records

When I contacted XXXX Customer Support they were to contact me back in 48 hours and did not. I then called their Customer Service and was told I would not be issued a refund and that this problem was "" impossible.

I opened the credit dispute with American Express eventually providing them with the Customer Support attempts at contact I had with XXXX and a Screen shot of my account from XXXX. This screen shot showed that I could not check my messages as my paid subscription was not recognized and for which American Express had record of withdrawal from my account for the transaction. I then called several separate divisions of American Express Customer Service and told them that was all the information that I had and that they could either be diligent & vigilant in attending to this matter and getting me my money that I was defrauded back or not. I was also told that I could not further escalate my concerns when multiple managers in their Customer Service divisions lied and told me they could not put me in contact with the corporate office. I then found their corporate office number online and called the following day. 

I received a call back and explained the issue and again stipulated that American Express should follow through on my legitimate transaction dispute and resolve the matter in a timely fashion. I received a call back a few days subsequent to that call from another person in their corporate office. I missed this call due to work and when I called back I left a voicemail explaining my reason for calling and requesting callback. Yesterday marked a full calendar week and several business days between their last call back and my last request for a call back.

555507,Mortgage,"My husband and I have a mortgage with Wells Fargo. We have had that same mortgage for nearly 10 years. We received a mailing from Wells Fargo with a refinance offer for a fixed rate that was more than 1 % less than what we currently have for less years than we have left on the loan. We applied, were approved, provided all documentation required of us and then were given the run-around. The mortgage company ordered an appraisal that was supposed to have been completed within a week. It took 3 times that amount of time and when it came back it was low, which was acknowledged by the closing agent, XXXX XXXX, who said "" all appraisals have been coming in very low. '' She said that we should not worry about it because their actuary was using our original purchase price and not the appraisal amount. This seemed logical since they were the ones who gave us the original loan based on the original purchase price! Not only was the appraisal low it was missing an entire bedroom, bathroom and fireplace. I was told that a request was going to be put in for the appraisal to be revised based on those details. The loan amount that Wells Fargo had on the paperwork was also incorrect, which I pointed out at least 7 times. These XXXX factors put us below the XXXX % required in order not to pay PMI. At the correct loan amount and with a revision for the additional bedroom, etc we would be fine. Numerous emails, and phone calls to the mortgage consultant, XXXX XXXX and the closing agent, XXXX XXXX, went ignored. We were told during one conversation that they doubted the appraisal would be adjusted, but yet had no proof that it would n't be. We called for a status update every other day and were ignored. Then when we did get in touch with XXXX she told us there was a backlog at the appraisal company and that we my need to reapply because the lock-in rate would most likely expire before the revision was done and closing could take place. And then there was ZERO follow-up until we received a letter saying our application had been denied. We called the number on the letter in order to receive the details of this decision and did not receive a call back. XXXX people, three voicemails and 4 days later we got a call back from XXXX XXXX who was not able to provide us with a logical reason for the denial and acknowledged that our appraisal had not been adjusted and that the process had just stopped, for no reason that he could explain. We asked to speak with a supervisor and were told that there was no supervisor. When we asked for the details behind the decision in writing, we were told he did not know who to contact. The letter we received said that we were entitled to the details of the information used in the decision to deny our refinance, but there is no contact information and no person to whom a letter should be addressed to obtain that report and no one we have spoken to at Wells Fargo is able to tell us how to obtain that information. This process is not just bad customer service. This is a scam. Wells Fargo took nearly {$500.00} of our money and then did nothing at all to make our refinance happen."

They then advised it would take 30 days for them to do research. I called each week to check the status and continued to make my monthly payment. Each time I called they also advised me that they were reporting negatively to the credit agencies and would reverse it pending research results. I continued to wait and called them back on/around XX/XX/2015. They then advised they made a mistake and it was n't the XXXX payment that was missing, but was the payment from XXXX. This would be six months later. I shared my disappointment with them. How could a company wait six months to say they are missing a payment? I was then advised I needed to send my XXXX statement, which I did and I still have no resolution to the issue. They now tell me it will be another 30 days which would be 7 months since they claim I missed a payment. Some reps at Seterus say they are reporting negatively to the credit agencies and others have said they are not. The rep I spoke to last advised she could n't even confirm if the XXXX bank statement I faxed had been received. So I guess I have to assume that it has. Each time I call I get different information. The handling of this situation seems too unethical and unfair to me as their customer. I 've made my payment each month. I 've given them the proof they need to show that and they still have not resolved the issue. It is also ridiculous to me that a regulated financial company would not realize they were missing a payment until 5 months later-which in reality I paid. The service I 've received has been horrible and the different information on every call does not lead me to believe they will ever solve this issue and I will have no other recourse, but to hire an attorney and spend money to show I 've already paid them.

I called Discover and they said yes, the payment had cleared. Discover had lied, the payment had not yet cleared. The scammers put a stop payment on it later.

They paid it off once more and my balance dropped to {$0.00} again.

They insisted I owe them {$7800.00} because there was stop payments made on the payments. I said if stop payments were made then you lied to me about the payment being free and clear and that makes Discover card responsible for the {$5200.00} not me. They disagree."

412187,Bank account or service,"In the last XXXX months Citi Bank has sent XXXX 'Time is Running Out ' letters to me. XXXX every 30 days the last XXXX months. This is excessive in itself. 

The XXXX letter I called them and spoke with XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Applied for the loan, qualified for the refinancing, was told after a month into the process XXXX XXXX has this loan on some list they are maintaining that blocks me from refinancing my home even though I have an excellent credit rating. This in itself is discrimination. Even though this home is on the list, I have owned this home since XX/XX/XXXX, have not missed XXXX payment nor been late on any payment, and I feel I am being discriminated against. As I understand it if this home was located elsewhere it would be eligible. This singles out certain individuals, and blocks them from taking advantage of opportunities that other individuals have. 

In XXXX I received the XXXX letter, calling Citi I requested these solicitation to stop since they are aware I am ineligible for this refinancing. In XXXX I received the third letter. Again I called and requested to be removed from this list. I have once again received the 'Time is Running Out ' campaign letter in XXXX. When I called them in XXXX I stated if I received another letter I would file complaints against them. This is baiting me to respond because like many individuals refinancing to lower monthly payment is desirable. I am an excellent customer and to be treated in this matter is unacceptable. 

Since Citi bank is ignoring my request and I continue to get this letter of which I qualify for they need to honor this refinancing at no closing cost as stated in their letter."

We are several payments behind but have been making regular monthly payments. They have now written to us saying they will accelerate foreclosure against the property. We believe that the modification was turned down incorrectly and that the bank is deliberately declining to help us."
480381,Credit card,"My complaint is regarding Citibank 's AAdvantage Platinum Select credit card. In short, I believe that this card is marketing and servicing strategy behind this card is knowingly deceptive. Citi is offering a financial incentive to open an account with them in the form of an alternative currency ( the offer I was promised was XXXX AAdvantage miles ). This alternative currency expires in 18 months unless a purchase is made with a specific vendor ( XXXX XXXX ), or the card is used ( a condition that is hidden in the fine print ). 

For the vast majority of consumers, the latter method of keeping their miles alive is obviously the more realistic option. In effect, this creates a significant financial penalty for closing the card ( often in the magnitude of hundreds of actual dollars ). As the card itself is not very competitive when it comes to rewards, the primary reason that I ( and I believe many others ) keep this card open and pay the {$95.00} annual fee is because Citi and XXXX have structured the card to essentially exploit this penalty. Their primary method of doing so is by limiting the ways in which the alternative currency can be used ( for example, miles can be used to pay for upgrades from coach to business class, but not for upgrades from a regular coach seat to a coach seat with additional leg room ). In addition, miles can not be used to partially pay for a ticket. These limitations effectively make it impossible to redeem miles in smaller denominations, which makes it much harder to redeem them at all. As a result, people are more likely to have miles left on their account and therefore a financial incentive to keep paying Citi a {$95.00} annual fee. 

Even more alarmingly, these limitations are entirely absent from any marketing materials for the card. I believe that most individuals somewhat reasonably assume that this alternative currency, which is only redeemable at one vendor, is at the very least applicable for any purchases at that vendor. Neither Citi nor XXXX XXXX would incur any significant cost for removing these limitations. When I called XXXX XXXX, they mentioned that they launched the paid upgrades within coach class over 4 years ago, meaning that they have had ample time to address this issue. The only reason that I believe these limitations still exist is because they allow Citi to maintain a deceptive financial incentive over their Cardmembers."

After a few more attempt calls to speak with a live responder - that where in fact continuously being transferred to XXXX or XXXX XXXX voice message - I 'm confident that I left XXXX messages on XXXX XXXX answer machine. Again, on another attempt I was passed to manager XXXX XXXX. She warned me that if I called again that office asking to speak with someone else, she would report me to the Police Department for harassing.

And as it appears, the clerks refused to answer my calls or where annoyed by me attempting to communicate. 

Manager XXXX XXXX XXXX was not in the office, but Manager XXXX XXXX was. 
I felt I needed to deal with my present issue - Police Warning about calling and my case. 
I did attempt to speak with a live person other than XXXX XXXX. 
I was informed that Mr.Clark ( identified as both manager and vice president ) was the best solution - also, I was not informed at that moment that he was not in the office for the day. 

XXXX XXXX, who after an hour did appear in the office. After my introduction he responded by informing me that any more calls to his Collection office would be responded with a call to my employer office and my supervisor. 

In all this attempts, I was never really able to deal with this 3 year old collection case. Their responses where sudden, warnings and threats. either call the police department, ignore the phone, transfer to voicemail, or warning of calling my office supervisor. 

I did leave a message informing XXXX XXXX XXXX that I did not accept them calling my office or neither did my supervisors want a collection office calling them. I work for XXXX. 

After XXXX XXXX warning about reporting me to thePolice on harassing, and XXXX XXXX threat of calling my employer to complain on me, and more, XXXX not being in the office, I felt I needed to make this report and obtain advice from the FTC/Consumer Finance. 

I was attempting to clear information on my case but all that appear where threats and warnings. I hope that phone records are optional and voice mail. Also, I hope that our conversations ( attempted ) where recorded by the collection company. 

I am making a complaint on the collection company threats and refusals."

270689,Mortgage,"Case number : XXXXXXXXRelated Case Number : XXXX Allegation # XXXX : The allegation that our Firm had a key role or any role in robo-signing is absurd. Our Firm has maintained the highest standards since 1982 in providing legal services. There has never been a finding by a state or federal court or the state Attorney General that our Firm ever participated in robo-signing. The borrower provides no cases, no evidence and no documentation for this defamatory allegation. 
ANSWER TO THIS STATEMENT : WHO : Foreclosure Processor XXXX Files For BankruptcyXXXX -- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has obtained a lawsuit that accuses a metro XXXX business of churning out robo-signed foreclosure documents. 
The firm McCalla Raymer farmed out the paperwork to XXXX XXXX, in XXXX Georgia. XXXX was the document processor, XXXX established by a group of former McCalla Raymer attorneys. XXXX provides foreclosure, bankruptcy, and loss mitigation processing services. XXXX ' customers include large mortgage servicers and law firms with large mortgage default resolution practices.

THEN : XXXX, a provider of legal services to the mortgage bankingIndustry, reached an agreement with XXXX XXXX to purchase someof the assets that currently support the non-legal support functions of thefirm. XXXX filed for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy protection on XXXX XXXX. Theagreement is subject to bankruptcy court approval and XXXX-based XXXX XXXX to purchase XXXX which federal regulatorsand state attorneys general are investigating the mortgage industry 's '' Robosigining '' scandal. The firm XXXX renamed XXXX toXXXX XXXX XXXXAND XXXX XXXX XXXX Files for Bankruptcy ProtectionXXXX-based XXXX announced XXXX to purchase XXXX which federal regulators and state attorneys general are investigating themortgage industry 's "" Robosigining '' scandal. The firm McCalla Raymer renamedXXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was the named creditor insome foreclosure proceedings. The reason is because the bankruptcyfilings including the statement of affairs will probably give some important clues to thereal money story on those mortgages where XXXX was involved. We will not find theloan receivables account that are mysteriously absent from virtually all suchfilings and FDIC resolutions. The question is that XXXX-based McCalla Raymerannounced McCalla Raymer to purchase XXXX XXXX which federal regulatorsand state attorneys general are investigating the mortgage industry 's '' Robosigining '' scandal. This XXXX started by Attorney of McCallaRaymer Firm BECAUSE Of Robo Signing filed bankruptcy SO XXXX its buyer form his reportedly former attorney.

I have n't heard anything from anyone except Your loans are past due and your account requires action. I 'm fed up with these people!

553581,Mortgage,"I have just successfully completed Chapter XXXX to save my home. The case was discharged XXXX 2016 with all payments made and a signed workout agreement in place with the mortgage company. I even received a refund from the Trustee. I made a payment in full of the amount due for the monthly payment on XXXX XXXX, 2016. On a statement dated XXXX XXXX, 2016, Wells Fargo stated "" Your loan has been referred to foreclosure. The amount to bring the account current may vary daily ; prior to sending funds, call us for a reinstatement or payoff quote .... '' This statement shows a payment for the full monthly amount due was received on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The Trustee paid the XXXX payment. The XXXX XXXX payment I made was for XXXX. 

I called Wells Fargo at XXXX the number listed on the statement. I spoke with XXXX in XXXX XXXX. She said she could not access the loan and would transfer me. I then spoke with XXXX in XXXX. He said that he did not see any foreclosure notice on my account and that my payments appeared to be current. 

I asked him to provide that information to me in writing. He declined. He said he had to get his supervisor to do that. I then spoke with his supervisor, XXXX XXXX who told me he could not provide any written documentation to me and that he would transfer me again. He assured me that the person he was transferring me to COULD provide the written documentation I requested. 

I then spoke with a rude, argumentative person XXXX XXXX who refused to tell me what city she was in because "" it is n't relevant '' and who then proceeded to badger me for calling and having the audacity to ask for "" written documentation. '' As I explained for the FOURTH time, I had documentation ( via the Federal Court ) that I had paid up to date and all I wanted was a written statement that my account was up to date and perhaps a note that the "" Your loan has been referred to foreclosure ...

'' That 's all I wanted. 

And after XXXX people and 45 minutes on the phone, all I got was a rude person who is "" going to open a case. ''"
69018,Credit reporting,"Starting in 2013, someone used my name and my address to create checks, and a fraudulent checking account. I filed a complaint with the FTC ( ref. XXXX ) and a police report ( RN. XXXX ). I recently found these checks on my credit report which does not belong to me"
196480,Credit card,"Barclaycard, is refusing to take the fraud charge off of my account. I was picking up my fianc 's daughter from school - when Barclay called me saying there was a charge on my account from target totaling about XXXX dollars. Informed them it was n't me and my card is on. The rep told me no problem, we 'll cancel the card and reverse the charges etc. 
Now, being a member of Barclay for a while, having XXXX credit cards from them and even using their online savings - I have been a content consumer for a while until now. A month later, I received a call from them saying that the purchase was a chip card purchase and to their knowledge chip cards can not be cloned. The rep, informed me to get a police report - which I did. The detective whom specializes in this took my case, gave me a police report and acted quickly. He contacted me, saying Barclay is giving him a hard time to reverse the charges but not to worry because he pulled the camera footage however Barclaycard has n't been trying to work with him. 
Barclaycard contacted me, asking me to send in the police report. I sent in the police report since XXXX, every time I call they claim they have n't gotten it. As of yesterday, they placed the fraud charges back onto my account and have told me I have failed to send in the documents for them ( police report ) even though I have faxed them over 5 times and have copies saying that I did fax them with the time and date on the transmission copy from the fax. I have even sent the documents via mail to them. Every time I call or the detective calls they give us the run around. I have always paid on time, and I have always used their services my whole family does however, due to this mishap my family is considering cancelling all their accounts. I have asked them repeatedly over and over if I can email it since they keep claiming they have not gotten faxes or mail from me and they keep telling NO. 
Another thing, every time I call they keep saying "" the notes on your account is very strange, not detailed and vague. '' I have begged them to replay the recordings since they record the conversations and they have refused. As this point, I have paid money again to overnight the reports ( police report and copies showing that I have faxed the report to them ) again. 

If you do research online, you can see cloning the chip card is possible. However even though they do agree it 's possible they keep saying "" to their company knowledge it 's not possible at this time with us. '' I work in the technology field, the chipcard has been out in XXXX since the XXXX 's, however there 's a reason why they use chip+pin and not chip+ signature. You can even purchase a chip cloning machine from XXXX. I have begged them to review my GPS signal, you name it to show that it was n't me however anything I recommend they refuse. I am a college student, working XXXX hours a week paying rent in New York and trying to keep up with bills and here they are bamboomzling me out of money that I have nothing to do with. 

You can do tons of research and see that Barclay is pulling the same thing with different people and it 's not fair. I can upload upload/scan/fax etc anything you want so you can show Barclaycard that I have been trying and have made numerous attempts. 

Last time I spoke to them, they insisted that the reason why the fax might not be going through is because it 's a central dispatch and I did n't list my old account number on the paper, when I did."

He agreed to cancel the application and I thought he had, until XXXX weeks later when I received a credit card. 

I cancelled the card through Bank of America ( not the problem company ). When I cancelled the card, the Bank of America representative told me that the credit card has an annual fee. The fee was not disclosed by XXXX. She suggested that I call XXXX to complain. 

After calling XXXX and navigating a menu clearly designed to prevent contact with a person, I eventually reached soneone who told me I could n't talk to a manager because I had to complain with the airport staff. When I objected to this, I was told that I could submit a complaint through their website. When I asked if I would get a response to the complaint, I was told that I would get a website-generated confirmation that my complaint had been submitted, but I could not get an answer when I tried to find out if I would get a response from an actual person who had read the complaint.

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX ( XXXX ) about the {$94.00} that was added back to my account under the line item described as "" Unpaid Accrued Interest '' on an account summary letter. 

After looking into the account, he identified the original balance financed and that the account was on a payment/interest reduction plan back in XXXX and XXXX. He explained the interest is coming from the interest reduction plan and added as "" Unpaid Accrued Interest '' and added back to the loan. 

When I asked if they ( Navient ) were trying to make up for the lost interest while the account was on an interest reduction plan. He replied, "" Yes ''. 

He offered his advise to refinance at a lower interest rate ( currently at 11.25 % ) or suggested that the borrower and myself pay-off the loan. 

It is my understanding that an interest reduction plan should be for that period of time and after that plan is complete, the consumer should n't get penalized for the plan by adding the lost interest back to the loan. Otherwise, why offer or have the option of these types of plans, if the company is going to try and get the money back from the consumer anyway."

433449,Debt collection,"Hunter Warfield, in response to my first CFPB complaint, presented incomplete verification and falsified statements ( claim that they provided me with signed documentation ) for my obligation and completely ignored the original problem which is their failure to provide me with proof that I owe this debt. I attempted to handle this matter via phone the first time it appeared on my credit report and was met with rudeness and unprofessional behavior. They failed to provide documents to me when I requested them over a year ago, removed the item from my credit report, THEN re-inserted it in XX/XX/2017. They have provided no proof that they complied with my request for validation and claim to "" verify '' this debt via CFPB by providing an illegible copy of a contract from another creditor. At the bottom of a list of false charges from the original creditor, it states that the original creditor has written off the debt. Therefore, since I have signed no contract with Hunter Warfield, and the original creditor has written off the falsified charges, I have no obligation to pay Hunter Warfield or their inflated charges. In addition, they violated a cease and desist letter which clearly stated communication must stop and no damage was to be done to my credit report because they failed to prove my obligation and I do not owe this debt."

In XXXX upon trying to renew the decal for the car, I was told the car had no owner. I reached out to XXXX XXXX who was the person I was interacting with upon the purchase. He gave me a number to a XXXX XXXX. Upon speaking to this individual I was advised he did not have any paper work in the car. After not being able to contact XXXX XXXX for some time, I reached out to the finance company which at the time was Western Funding. After speaking with their titles department, I was advised by XXXX XXXX, they have been investigating this company which was also known as XXXX XXXX XXXX for fraud. They had XXXX cars with no titles to them from this company. Their legal department was looking into this, but in the mean time, I still could not renew the decal for the car. After filing a report with the Florida State XXXX, I was able to renew the decal and I was also given the title to the car. The finance company wanted the title to the car, even after all the fraud that was going on with the car dealerships. They repossess the car. I still have the title due to it having no lender on the original title."

I was not able to do so for Experian.

I attempted XXXX different browsers on XXXX computers, I renamed the files, I tried to scan the pages individually. Nothing worked. Not a single representative with Experian provided me with a phone number, an email address, a name or anything else to assist me in sending these documents. The accounts in question should never have been reported as delinquent and are preventing my husband and I from making an offer on a home as we can not obtain a pre-approval. I am beyond furious that on top of being penalized and having my FICO driven down by erroneous late payments ( 3 years of late payments being recorded while these loans were included with a bankruptcy by the co-borrower on the account, not even me! ) and now I can not even update the credit file in order to obtain a home loan and not a single person with Experian lifted a finger to try to help me in resolving this quickly. It had already dragged on for more than 2 weeks. I am quite sure there are other secure methods for sending information, or someone within the company who could have assisted. Further, if their website is n't going to work then someone should be taking responsibility for ensuring there is either an alternative method that can be used besides mail ( seriously, you want me to wait ANOTHER 7-10 business days on top of the 10 I 've already waited because YOUR website is n't working?????!!!! ) to send information securely. As it is, we will likely lose the home we are trying to make an offer on due to mistakes that are not mine because no one was willing to help me."

I was told again that they would "" fix '' it and apply them correctly, but I would have to wait 7-10 days, then I was told 3-5 days then told that it would be fixed today but I still would be unable to have confirmation until Tuesday. I asked what is going to happen when I make a payment this month that should be applied to the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I was told there was no way for them to guarantee that they would apply that payment correctly and I would have to monitor my account. This is absolutely ridiculous, PHH is supposed to be a loan servicer they should be able to properly apply payments to the account. At this point the only acceptable resolution is to have my account transferred to a servicer that can handle accepting monthly payments."

I was advised I would receive correspondence if they needed info and case would close in 60 days and the credit would be authorized if they found on my behalf and if not, I would be notified first. I never heard anything else from Suntrust. I tried several times to check status online but system was down for a long time.

Suntrust waited until 2 days before XXXX to do the reversal, wiping my account clean so I could not buy XXXX dinner- WITH NO NOTICE OR CONTACT. Then I encountered several NSF fees. They claim the reason for the reversal was because the merchant claimed to offer a full refund and I refused. That makes no sense. Had they offered, I would have accepted! They offered only discounts for future purchases. But, Suntrust- instead of contacting me and asking for email correspondence ( which I have still ) or photos of my wedding to prove I did not wear their product ( which I also have ) or proof the full refund was never offered ( again, email chain ) ... Suntrust wiped out my bank account after the 60 day period and raked up NSF charges galore and kept my direct deposit from my payroll check. So, here my family and I will sit on XXXX eating cereal or sandwiches ( because my bank account is in the negative and we could not buy things for a XXXX meal ). I have made several attempts with Suntrust agents to get them to understand that I did not overdraw my account. That I received no correspondence. I have all my emails from Suntrust.

I would highly advise anyone searching for a bank, to not go to Suntrust. After this experience, I will be changing banks asap. They care nothing about their customers. The fact that they waited until two days before XXXX ( past the 60 day time frame ) when I had several pending transactions ( which resulted in NSFs ) to reverse a valid claim ... tells me just how much they DO N'T care."

During this time, my mother fell XXXX, and I was the only XXXX left to care for her. I had to leave my job, and my funds went toward her healthcare expenses. It was a very rough and difficult period. Due to the circumstances, I was unfortunately unable to make the payment toward my Wells Fargo credit card. 
I realise I made a mistake in falling behind, but up until that point, my payment history with Wells Fargo has been spotless. When I was able to gain income once again, I quickly paid the debt in full, making it my priority. Im not proud of this negative mark on my credit report, its the only XXXX I have, and as a long standing Wells Fargo client I would be extremely grateful if you could honour my request to remove this derogatory mark from my credit report. It would help me immensely in securing other lines of credit so that I can further improve my credit score. 
If the late payment can not be removed entirely, I would still be appreciative if you could make a goodwill adjustment. 
Thank You, XXXX XXXX"

I got the same Representative 2 times before my husband could actually tell them to please speak to me to fix this.

119484,Student loan,"I have XXXX Stafford loans being serviced by Navient.

On the navient website, when you pay extra, it gives you the option to select whether or not to advance your due date, just as every other loan servicer I have ever dealt with. I always select NOT to advance my due date and have the extra simply go towards the principle, however, they have been advancing my due date nonetheless- meaning that they have NOT been putting the extra money simply towards principle as I had intended, but using it as simply a payment towards the extra due date. Thus, they 've been making more money off of interest payments by not allowing me to pay down my principle as quickly as I have been trying. When I emailed them about this, their response was as follows "" ... Please note that each payment received will advance the due date by one month if it equals the minimum due, even if you request to not advance the due date, but it wo n't advance the due date more than one month. If you select online to not advance your due date and do n't want it advanced by the one month that it will automatically advance, then you will need to send us an email after each payment is submitted with your specific payment instructions ...

456499,Credit card,"XXXX XXXX I was hoping WELLS FARGO would have come its sense and realize that it 's calling ME, the card holder, the consumer and customer a liar. But in essence, knowing full well all the issue we had with identity theft and precautions we need to now take, and knowing full well WELLS FARGO made well over {$350.00} just in 3 months of over 12 months I had the card. I did not complain about the {$10.00} atm charge you charged me every time I used the card or your high interest rates. And I was never late once with my bill. Not to mention I can show with phone records and emails how many times I had to call in to WELLS FARGO to handle simple small issues over and over and over again. I can promise you as well over two hours a week was spent dealing with issues that I was told once I signed the forms would be handled. And they never did, they always came back. As well I also There were several disputes on the card that were active when WELLS FARGO closed the card down. And oddly the card just so happened to equal {$1000.00} which was my deposit. I have lost four times over with every company, not only not caring of my extreme identity theft issues, but taking advantage of our situation when we paid our bills and we stayed in contact with each company every issues doing whatever company policies were, but in the end, those things never mattered either. So, I let all those issues go, all those many many many issues. And I told you guys I was willing work with you, but you, again, WELLS FARGO has found a way to call the consumer who took the time to call right away when there was an issue on the card, a liar. So, I your customer, lied to you about the {$200.00} ATM dispute in XXXX. Cause what you told me was the MERCHANT saw me take the money of the machine. Well let me rectify this again for you, and I Will not discuss other disputes again, I am simply going go over this XXXX ATM at roughly XXXX at a convenient store located across from XXXX, next to XXXX XXXX Here is what is wrong with WELLS FARGO "" theory '' When I attempted to take the money out of ATM, nothing came out and I called WELLS FARGO right away reading off the transaction number that came out. On my way out of the store, there was only woman working behind the counter. I did not even approach her and she could not even see me where the ATM is my back was to her, she DID N'T EVEN KNOW THAT I DID NOT GET THE XXXX XXXX DOLLARS, AND IT 'S NOT AS IF SHE WAS STARING AT ME THROUGH MY BACK WATCHING EVERY CUSTOMER GOES TO THE ATM. AND SHE WAS NOT THE MANAGER, SHE WAS AN EMPLOYEE, YOU STATED A MANAGER SAW ME. IF HE WAS THERE, HOW COULD HE HAVE SEEN ME THROUGH THE COFFEE DISPLAY AND MY BACK TOWARD THE COUNTER ALMOST XXXX feet away. AS WELL IF I DID NOT MENTION IT TO ANYONE AT THE COUNTER, THEN WHEN WELLS FARGO CALLED TO TALK TO THE MANAGER, HOW WOULD HE EVEN OF KNOWN WHO I WAS. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. PUll THE TAPE FROM THAT NIGHT, THEY MUST HAVE ONE, AS IT 's BY A BUSY AREA. BUT HERE IS WHERE IT IS ALSO OBVIOUS, MY PHONE RECORDS SHOW THAT I CALLED WELLS FARGO TWO TIMES RIGHT AFTER THE TRANSACTION TO REPORT IT, BUT HERE IS WHERE YOUR AGAIN, IS JUST MORE PROOF, AT THE TIME I TRIED TO TAKE OUT THE {$200.00}, the only amount of money I Was allowed to withdraw from my credit card was {$200.00} a day. So then why when after I reported the XXXX never came out of the machine, did I few minutes later go to the motel next door atm and withdraw XXXX from there. If I did get the first XXXX logically I would not try another ATM cause it would be pointless, I only had a XXXX maximum withdrawal. You allowed a merchantt to commit a crime. And I given you guys enough chances to fix this and other disputes you already gave me then took back.

I found out that my mortgage has been moved to XXXX XXXX. I never authorized this transfer nor requested the Bank of America to make any changes to my mortgage.

410459,Mortgage,"We have been married 50 years, XXXX of which my husband worked as a XXXX XXXX XXXX. We are both college educated, hard-working individuals. We never missed a single mortgage payment in 48 years of home ownership until beginning the loan modification process. We are lodging a complaint against Wells Fargo for mishandling this process and their ultimate resolution. In XXXX we had a 7 % mortgage interest rate with Wachovia, and with the declining economy, the interest rates dropped to 5 %. I, XXXX, was working full time. My employer was determined to keep staff employed, but to do so, had to cut our working hours in half. While making a regular monthly mortgage payment, my husband went to the local branch of Wachovia to personally ask a bank representative about refinancing the interest rate of our loan. The loan officer told us about the new "" Mortgage Modification Program ''. We were assured by Wachovia that the modification was the "" best '' way to lower our interest rate and that in order to qualify for the "" modification '' program, we needed to stop paying our mortgage payment in order to show that we were "" in need '' of a loan modification. We did what was requested. We never would have stopped making the mortgage payments if not instructed to do so by the officers at the bank. We first attempted to complete the modification process by ourselves by submitting Application Forms, XXXX forms, bank statements, Profit & Loss Statements, paystubs, Hardship Letters, explanations of income and expenses, tax returns, checklists, utility bills, social security award letters, pension award letters, and more. We re-submitted these repeatedly. Every time we submitted a complete set of documents, Wachovia would let our file languish for weeks and then instruct us to send additional redundant documents, always assuring us that our file was in "" Active Modification Review. '' After a frustrating year of this process and being turned down, we hired a law firm in XXXX. After complying with redundant requests for information over a period of almost two years, the XXXX Law firm was unsuccessful. We can not comprehend why were turned down for a LOWER monthly payment, when we had been successfully making HIGHER payments over the many previous years. We then hired a XXXX law firm. During the course of their efforts to get our loan modified ( again with many repeated submittals of requested information ) ; Wachovia was taken over by Wells Fargo who did not honor any of the process that we had gone through with Wachovia. We began another process of re-submitting the same information. In XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo finally approved a loan modification -- almost 4 years after the start of the process -- at a monthly payment that is almost {$1700.00} per month more than our original mortgage payment. We have struggled to make these payments using up almost all of our reserves and also accruing credit card debt. During this 4 year time period, banks would not take any payments from us until the loan modification was complete. The final modification includes all of the principal plus interest that was unpaid during their lengthy modification process, stacked atop our original principal balance. We are being charged interest on the interest and principal that was not paid during the modification process even though we were complying with the bank 's instructions not to make any payments during this process. The outcome of our efforts is that even with a slightly lower interest rate applied to this new capitalized principal, our monthly mortgage payment is approximately $ XXXX/month higher than it was when we began our long struggle to achieve a loan modification. There is NO REASON AT ALL, in today 's technologically advanced world that the modification process should have taken four years!"

I have enclosed a permission letter from my lawyer in the exhibits and faxed a copy today to my POC at Ocwen to by pass any legal confusion if that Ocwen can communicate with me. I want to make this clear that any in the form of documentation or information should be sent back though this complaint. If my POC at Ocwen needs to contact me the letter will allow this they have my number and email on file. My goal here is to have a open line of communication and resolve some errors due to mismanagement of my loan and hopefully settle it out of court."

However, PNC Bank refuses to offer such assistance in order to modify my loan from a "" balloon '' to a fix rate mortgage.

PNC "" denied '' my application to refinance and for a modification because I was unemployed. I 'm back to work now and I still do n't qualify for a permanent modification because now I have income. PNC has been "" Deceptive '' in their practices to make a decision for my application to obtain a modification.

137488,Student loan,"For years I have been trying to get my cosigner released from my loan. I always pass the pre-qualifcations phase but then when I submit my application its denied. The last time I did this. I was told that they would not release me no matter what and that when my cosigner died they will go after her estate. I have never been late once and have followed all of their rules. My cosigner is XXXX, has no estate, and has never ever had to amek payments. My history of paying this loan is great as well as I make significant income. Today I was told by a customer service person that my cosigner wo n't ever be released even though their qualifications state that i meet them. She said the only way to get my cosigner off is to pay the loan off myself. She was rude and condescending. My statement is vague and I do not believe my balance nor the amount I owe is correct. It says I am paid ahead but I have never heard of such of thing. I also don ; t understand all of the threats when I have always paid this loan on time always."

772659,Student loan,"I had a student loan with Bank of America ( XXXX ) that went into default. I rehabilitated the loan with the government satisfactorily. Bk of America ( XXXX ) and the credit bureaus refuse to update the status of the loan from stating "" student loan permanently assigned to government ; Closed XXXX '' to reflect that it has been rehabilitated and paid successfully. Further the last time the account was active was XXXX of XXXX. Not only have we passed the statute of limitation for New York, we are approaching the 7 year threshold. This is very negatively affecting my credit and impacting my chances of securing a mortgage even though I took care of the default. They are fraudulently reporting the debt as active as of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Lastly, they are reporting XXXX loans that I had with them more than once on my credit report. They are reporting the same loans under different names with the same account number. Loan # XXXX is being reported XXXX once under the name XXXX/B of A and account # XXXX for {$13000.00} and XXXX under the name Bk of America with account # XXXX for {$13000.00}. This is the loan that has been rehabilitated successfully and should only be reported once! Loan # XXXX is being reported XXXX under the name of XXXX/Bank of America with account # XXXX with a balance of {$600.00} and a XXXX reporting under the name BK of America account # XXXX and balance of {$600.00}.

528748,Mortgage,"In 2014 my home in XXXX Maryland was foreclosed on by my lender ( PNC XXXX despite the fact that I received no less than XXXX bonafide offers from buyers that were willing to do a short sale. Additionally, during the foreclosure process I was not granted a mediation with PNC despite the fact that I properly and timely submitted a request for the same with the court. I believe that PNC acted in bad faith in the foreclosure process by rejecting XXXX short sale offers and by not taking into consideration that my legal rights were impaired as a result of not receiving a court mandated mediation. Instead the foreclosure sale proceeded and the home sold for less than what was originally offered by the prospective short sale purchasers. I sent XXXX letters to PNC recounting the situation and seeking to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. My first letter went unanswered and the second merely brushed me off in the traditional big corporate manner. The impact on my credit and tax consequences for the foreclosure have been very serious. I understand repayment of any deficiencies are my responsibility and I have made arrangements with creditors to true up my obligations. However, I am of the firm belief that PNC unduly enriched itself by proceeding with a foreclosure in lieu of other reasonable options which I presented them with in good faith. I am not asking for monetary remuneration however, I am seeking to have the foreclosure removed from my credit report. I have records to support all of my claims above and I am seeking the CFPB 's help here."

545711,Credit card,"Citibank 's mobile app does not allow one to view payments or pending payments. This makes it more likely to submit double payments. There is no warning against submitting a double payment. This makes it likely that the credit card bill is double billed creating overdraft issues for the payment ( checking ) account. 

I had this problem and contacted both institutions ( Citi credit cards and the checking account ), but the double payment was never removed from Citi despite multiple calls. When I tried to make the next monthly payment, Citi said they reprocessed the double payment, and they could do nothing about it. I found XXXX in the Florida office at Citi customer service very unhelpful when this problem cropped up again the next month. First I had to get my payment ( checking ) account made "" active '' over several calls. Then, when it was active, the double payment from the previous month was charged. If I had just paid my balance in full right away, the double payment from the previous month would have overdrawn my checking account again! I am waiting to see if the double payment is processed before paying that part of my balance at Citi credit cards."

Discover has acknowledged to me that their pre-approval language is misleading, and that they intend to change that, but that does n't do anything for me - I 'm still a victim of their deceptive practices. I would still like to obtain a Discover card - and can assure them that I am going to be a good long term customer, but I 'm very discouraged by this practice."

I forwarded this documented proof to Shellpoint Mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX. I have not been able to call or speak to the department that handles payment disputes because Shellpoint refuses to direct my contact to that department. I have been repeatedly told that the payment disputes department will only communicate with me via mail or email regarding their research of my payment dispute. As of today, XXXX XXXX, I am continuing to receive notices of our delinquency on our mortgage. We have never missed a mortgage payment or been late on a mortgage payment since we purchased our home in XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, Shellpoint Mortgage changed their payment address in XX/XX/XXXX. We believe this is a contributing factor in their inability to properly identify and credit our payment. As a faithfully paying customer for nearly 20 years, we are extremely frustrated by this lack of competence, compassion, and understanding. We have invested countless hours attempting to resolve this issue with Shellpoint mortgage only to be told time and again that we are unable to speak directly with anyone who can help resolve our issue, and those denials are followed by repeated receipt of late payment notices."

At this point I figured they could not supply the required documentation and left it alone. As of XXXX XXXX 2016, XXXX XXXX XXXX has now requested a summons from the court in order to solicit a judgment against me for this unverified debt for which the agency they hired failed to answer the requested letter I sent. According to research this tactic is how they get judgments against consumers which can negatively affect there financials."
754460,Credit card,XXXX issued me an American Express Card which I never received nor activated the card. American Express has turned their annual fees over to collections and have filed it on my credit report.

SHE gave them the card number, as I walked into room. She told me what I happened and I immediately went to hotel front desk, figuring she had been scammed. We called the credit card company immediately, to report the fraud. and there was {$2800.00} billed to our card already.We received a letter, from Syncrony fraud division, we filled it out and sent it in. We thought that was the end of the issue. Today I received a letter From Synchrony stating the fraud was our fault and now we owe them the {$2800.00}. My understanding is they are not following the law themselves, by trying to get consumer to pay for the fraud"

Consumer e-mailed Diversified Consultants to inquire as to its reason for placing a statute of limitations-barred, bogus wireless bill on both my XXXX and XXXX credit reports. The rep responded that the account could not be located and requested I send my name and address to verify the account. Of course, I refused.

While I was fresh out of XXXX XXXX, they made sales pitches to me stating federal/private loans would guarantee my future. I would be placed with a well paying job right out of school and my loans would only help my future by improving my credit lines. From the application paper work to the application for federal/private aid through student loans, this was all facilitated through a rubber stamp type action, much like we saw on home mortgages. I fought every step of the way to gain an education which I thought I had paid for and ultimately left me without work and the ability to repay my loans. As the schools have no closed and previous lawsuit, much like the CFPB in Case No. XXXX are the exact situations I faced. There was no truth in lending and I have n't been able to obtain assistance from Navient, my loan servicer.

XX/XX/2014 they marked the payment late for 30 days when they received it on time for credit reporting on XX/XX/2014. Yet the statement shows received on XX/XX/2014 and processed XX/XX/2014. Something similar happened in the next month. The payment was due on XX/XX/2014. However that date was on a Sunday. XXXX processed on the Monday XX/XX/2014.

Three months later, and without any form of notification, Nationstar is now covering this cost in my billing, with additional fees and an expectation that I will be paying another couple hundred dollars to pad the escrow account I never authorized.

So in turn they received an additional overdraft fee of {$37.00} on XXXX XXXX, 2016. 
Now on XXXX XXXX, 2016 I was charged XXXX unavailable funds fees for funds that I transferred from another account at the same bank. So they did not make the funds available in my account right away even though it should have been because a transfer from the same bank should be treated like cash. They are crediting a transfer that I did on XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. Then charged me XXXX unavailable funds fees on top of it of for {$37.00} each.

As I was planning to begin repayments of prior loans and loans ending their grace period, I noted many inconsistencies on my online account. The online accounts are not updated to reflect payments made regularly. It was also impossible to determine when payments were due for different loans. This information was not only unavailable online, but inconsistent with different customer service representatives even within the same day. Over the last month, I had been contemplating consolidating with another company due to the poor service. I am a responsible consumer and my experience in trying to repay my loans has been terrible.

Then Ditech harassed me by trying to make me submit a new borrower 's assistance application removing child support because it helps me. So, Ditech is falsely claiming that I have not submitted an application because it does not want to process my borrower 's assistance application for HAMP that it received on XX/XX/2016. 

Then Ditech harassed me by claiming that line XXXX of my IRS XXXX was blank when it was n't. Ditech provided a different address and asked for a new IRS XXXX just like it was trying to make me submit a new borrower 's assistance form. 

Then Ditech harassed me by creating several different addresses for loss mitigation to try and create plausible deniability that it had not received my XX/XX/2016 borrower 's assistance form proven by the tracking information. 

Ditech harassed me by falsifying it needed 30 days recent pay stubs that did not exist to keep from processing my borrower 's assistance application for HAMP. 

Then Ditech harassed me by misrepresenting its XX/XX/2016 denial for HAMP due to my housing to income ratio being XXXX % instead of XXXX % because Ditech would not remove child support as if it is denying my current XX/XX/2016. 

Then Ditech harassed me by theatening that if I do not accept their alleged missed payments they claim happened over two years ago that I will not be in imminent default while they are misrepresenting my current housing to income ratio. 

Ditech harassed me by not providing me a dedicated representative for loss mitigation."

Either they are guilty of gross negligence in calculating my property taxes not once, not twice, but three times ( because they also got it wrong prior to my closing ) or they are a predatory lender.

450986,Bank account or service,"On XX/XX/2017, I filed a debit card claim with Wells Fargo. The rep who took down the claim sounded as someone of XXXX descent. Upon asking him for a claim number, he said the claim department closed and that he was unable to provide a claim number. Mind you, Wells Fargo always provides a claim number at the conclusion of a claim initiation. Suspected he merely did n't know what he was doing, I decided to call again to properly file the claim. Lo and behold, I called a second time only to find out that a claim was never filed by the XXXX rep. I went a head and successfully filed the claim ( XXXX ) with this second representative named XXXX XXXX, which proved the previous rep was incompetent or simply did n't want to perform his duties. XXXX XXXX confirmed the claim in the amount of {$4100.00}. During the questionnaire, XXXX XXXX asked whether I used the debit card at an ATM or POS terminal where the card was declined. I answered "" Yes '' and provided the address. On XX/XX/2017, I called as to the status of the claim. During this call, I discovered the claim amount to be less than what was previously confirmed ( {$4100.00} ) by XXXX XXXX. Upon asking for this representative 's name, she demurred, citing Wells Fargo policy does not allow representatives to provide their names. This unidentified rep went over the transactions with me once more and provided a different claim amount, which I ca n't recall at this writing. At the conclusion of the phone call, I was assured that my account would be credited the full amount of the claim by the next business day. Today ( which is said next business day ), not seeing the credit on my account, I contacted Wells Fargo. Upon calling, a woman of XXXX, answered my call from the debit card claim department. This woman was extremely rude, insolent and downright accusatory. After inquiring the purpose of my call, she informed that my claim was denied. When asked her as to the reasons for denial, she read out the computer notations, which stated "" ... .customer called and said card was always in her possession and that no one else had access to her card ... .... '' For good measure, the rude woman added herself "" Well, like the note says, when you filed the claim, you said you had your card and no one else had access to it. Now, it sounds like you are changing your story. '' I objected and told the rude woman that I never said that card was in my possession. I simply stated that I thought it was in my possession because I never had to use physically ( swipe ) use it. I made it clear that I 've been in the habit of having all my card information stored in my computer so as to make it more accessible when making a purchase online or on the phone in lieu of always have to rummage through my purse of drawer to look for the card. The rude woman continued to insult me by insinuating that I was responsible for, or authorized the transactions. I told her I need the matter re-investigated properly. She put me on hold for a protracted period time, came back and said the claim will remain denied due to the statement I allegedly made. It is obvious that Wells Fargo denied the claim without the benefit of a proper investigation. The Rep ( either the XX/XX/XXXX, or XX/XX/XXXX ) erroneously -- perhaps intentionally -- notated incorrect information in regards to my claim. They framed my statement as if I made it absolutely clear that my card was knowingly in my possession the entire time. They ignored the possibility that one of the guests who were visiting for the holiday or someone else could have easily compromised my card and used it without my authorization. Again, I used my card for lots of online purchase, and for the sake of convenience, store its information on my computer to have it readily available. Using my card online does n't translate to it being in my possession.

447815,Debt collection,"My personal information was fraudulently used as a co-signee by XXXX XXXX XXXX for a medical credit. It was approved for her with out proper verification.

517637,Credit reporting,"Equifax should have arrived at the correct resolution to the following dispute, in light of the fact that the debt collection agency that placed false information on our accounts is in violation of Federal law. They should also restore us to a high credit score. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, through its representative, XXXX XXXX, has a false claim that I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and my wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX, owe a debt that we do not owe. They have filed this on our credit reports, despite the evidence that their claims are inaccurate. This is a clear violation of the law by their false representation of an amount and legal status of the so-called debt they are claiming. We provided them the information and evidence that they are in error, but they have since failed to correct their error. 

Originally, a dispute had arisen with a potential landlord that was settled in court. When judgment was entered in court, we satisfied the judgment, since XXXX 2015. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX has continued to negatively affect our credit score since that time by insisting that we owed an amount which is simply false and inaccurate. 

XXXX refused to correct their records, despite the fact that they were made aware that they are violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Acts ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, especially section XXXX ( false or misleading representation of "" A ) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt '' ). We provided them the evidence of the notice of satisfied judgment, and XXXX XXXX, their representative, refuses to correct this information. 

We provided proof of the satisfied judgment amount and closed legal status, which was significantly less judgment than their client was claiming. We notified them that further delay requires further action provided by the laws of the United States. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A fair resolution will be the correction of the false information that XXXX has placed on our credit files. Any payment the court needed us to pay was already paid in court, and the amount the court requested, which again we satisfied, was already much lower than what XXXX XXXX XXXX is claiming to collect. My wife and I should be compensated for the monetary value of the combined change/loss in our credit scores due to their false report. 
Most importantly, they must cease and desist from wrongfully reporting the legal status or amount on our credit reports."

OR repaid XXXX XXXX {$6000.00} through their tuition protection program but XXXX XXXX ( now Navient ) still holds me responsible for the remaining money including the 6mos of stipend that I never received.

The salesman told me that if I signed up for a best buy credit card that I would have the option to either get points back for my purchase or get 12 months interest free. We went with the interest free deal. He then gave the option to get a visa card or a best buy only card. The associate advised us that the visa card could be used anywhere and that it still would be interest free from the date of the purchase. 

This information was misleading. It was n't until a few months after we used the card for a big purchase did we realize that the card was not interest free, but only the first purchase was interest free. When we called customer service and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX in idaho, she advised that what someone says verbally is not considered a verbal contract and thus when the terms and conditions were mailed out after the purchase, we should have read that instead of going on what a sales person stated.

When I did they will not answer or return my calls. So I looked into it by checking my credit and it is saying I owe XXXX different amount totaling XXXX. I could n't believe it. So I called XXXX back and demanded an break down to why I owe that rediculous amount. They told me to get bent. I believe there is some illegal stuff going on with this. No one will contact me or give me paper work on the break down so I can take it to a lawyer. If you look at my credit it is listed as IQ DATA INT XXXX and IQ DATA INT XXXX.

According to your website customers enjoy benefits ' [ ... ] such as Purchase Protection* and Fraud Protection* when making purchases online or in store with Bluebird. Regarding fraud, it specifically says 'If your Bluebird Card is lost or stolen, we protect you against fraudulent purchases. ' According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, if reported within 2 days of discovering the transactions, I can not be held liable for fraudulent transactions. I reported this lost/stolen immediately after discovering it, well within the time frame and therefore I should not have been held liable. Furthermore, their ten minute decision shows that you did not perform due diligence in investigating this, and therefore have sold a banking product in bad faith are in breach of contract and have disregarded federal and state banking laws. 

I wrote a letter to the CEO and was contacted by their Executive Relations office, but was told that these are n't really bank accounts and that their profit margins on these are slim. I countered that they clearly say customers are protected against fraud and that these accounts are in fact marketed as bank account replacements by AMEX. I have a new account now, but I do not feel a proper investigation was done, and I feel that AMEX is not honouring their terms of service. I would like a fraud refund of {$290.00}."

275171,Mortgage,"PHH was inadequate in providing clear, precise information and was flippant in regards to my XXXX level throughout the process. Each time I called, they never seemed to have my details handy. The day before AND day of closing, both my realtor and I questioned the amount I needed to bring to closing. Even though we XXXX asked for the amount PHH stated was needed to close to be XXXX checked, the title company told me what I needed and I brought exactly what they said. In less than 3 months, PHH reanalyzed my account XXXX and found they did NOT include enough into the escrow to cover all taxes when they stated what I needed to bring to closing. I called and I could either pay {$2200.00} to bring my escrow up to date for incorrectly determined taxes, or raise my monthly payments by over {$300.00} to cover them, making up for the loan officer 's error. Taxes had been underestimated by {$1500.00}. Suddenly I had to deal with my monthly payments increasing from $ XXXX, to $ XXXX for the life of the loan. I called in the middle of XXXX 2014 and asked how to get my monthly payments back down to what they had been stated at closing. I needed to add in the {$2200.00} to my escrow. I paid the {$2200.00} XXXX memo on check stating "" Escrow only '' ) and {$900.00} XXXX "" XXXX mortgage '' ) XXXX/XXXX/14. I had to call back the XXXX week of XXXX because they posted the money incorrectly. I again had to call back XXXX XXXX because I was getting ready to schedule XXXX 's mortgage payment only to see that my monthly payments never adjusted back down to what PHH stated it would once I paid up the escrow. My next step was contacting the Texas State Attorney General 's Department XXXX XXXX and Mortgage XXXX, hoping that my complaint could be viewed by experts in such areas. The investigator assigned to my case was extremely helpful and explained what she would be doing and her findings. Her review of the facts found that PHH was in violation of Texas state practices on mortgages and they would be requiring PHH to either correct the matter or owe a hefty fine to the state. Upon further review it was determined that PHH had the proper information ; however, PHH omitted it on the final paperwork. PHH Mortgage determined that my initial contact with the State warranted a {$250.00} good will refund, which was insulting. After the lawyers discussed numbers, PHH determined that there was no way to get my mortgage back down to what I agreed/signed for if they kept everything the same. That being said, the taxes that PHH Mortgage did not estimate for was {$1500.00} ; I had to put out {$2200.00} for my escrow to be caught up. The {$1300.00}, not including the good will check is {$250.00} less than what they said they underestimated my taxes for, and {$870.00} less than what I actually paid into trying to make things right. The checks were finally received around XXXX XXXX. Since they would be void after 180 days, they have been deposited, but I am not satisfied that this was the solution to the problem. My budget was based off the reality of life : gas for my transportation, credit card payments, electric bills, water bills, gas bills, trash, car/motorcycle insurance, groceries, pet expenses, and the biggest XXXX - XXXX. I understand that some things are not considered when applying for a loan due to the law, but I consider my XXXX condition because it 's a big factor.

I emailed it to him like he said - elite @ citibank in the subject line i put attn : XXXX, team XXXX. My husband also had to do this. Eventually my husband 's posted but mine still has n't. 

Here is where it gets even worse, i have now contacted citi about this 11 times.On times 1-9 they said that i would post on next statement and if it did n't they would follow up with me. Well, very frustratingly, they have never posted and they never follow up with me. Yesterday, through private message ( time # 10 ), XXXX told me it did n't qualify. This floored me after all these contacts i have had with citi and i called in. The lady i spoke to 2 mroe times yesterday assured me that she would contact her supervisor when he arrived and call me back and take care of it. 

Guess, what, she never called back! I know this should n't surprise me as that is what everyone has done. I would encourage Citi to go back in and look and the contact i have had and time i have devoted into getting my airline credit on this expensive card. I have no doubt spend over 6 hours of frustration trying to get this done on my time outside of work. I am very highly disappointed in Citi 's actions.

231517,Consumer Loan,"I am writing this letter as a complaint in regards to misinformation I 've received from multiple representatives and management at Ally Financial which has caused me to become behind on my account, accrue late fees and receive a negative mark on my credit. I decided that I no longer need the mechanical protection package that I purchased on my vehicle so I called that company to cancel it. I was told that since there was a finance company holding the lien, the money they refunded in the amount of {$3000.00} would be sent to the lien holder. I was paying my payments about 15 days past the due date due to how my paydays are set up. I confirmed with XXXX that the funds were sent out XXXX/XXXX/15. I called Ally that day to inform them. I spoke with a woman and requested if the funds could pay the payment that was due which was XXXX/XXXX/15 and the rest be applied to principal and the late fees. She advised me that it would all be posted towards payments. She asked me to follow up XXXX/XXXX/15 to make sure the check was received. I monitored the account that week and saw that the payment posted XXXX/XXXX/15. It showed my account with the next due payment of about {$300.00} for XXXX/XXXX/15. I felt relieved that everything was completed in a timely manner. I decided to check again after the weekend onXXXX/XXXX/15. To my surprise the funds were reversed and reposted all to principal and I was due again for XXXX/XXXX/15 showing {$1700.00} due. My stomach dropped because I had already used the funds XXXX/XXXX/15 to get ahead on other bills. I immediately called at XXXX CST and spoke with a female rep who stated everything was ok, and that in her system I was due for XXXX/XXXX/15 for about {$300.00}. She said everything was fine and I did n't have to worry. Then, XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX CST I received a collections call. I returned the call a few minutes later and spoke with a female rep who looked at my account and told me I was past due and that the funds were posted to principal because of some partial payments in the beginning of my loan. I explained that was n't the case. She insisted on that theory so I requested to speak with a supervisor. I sat on hold somewhere between XXXX minutes, which was also frustrating due to me being at work during this call. I spoke with a supervisor named XXXX who took a quick look at the payment history and said the funds did n't post to the current payments because of the due date change in the beginning of my loan where I made a partial payment then the extension I did in XXXX 2015. I explained to him that XXXX as well as XXXX and my understanding on extensions is that the payments that are extended are placed at the end of the loan, so there 's no way these funds should pay for payments that technically are n't due yet. He agreed with me and took a closer look. He then said he 's not sure why this happened and would have the funds reposted to my payments and explained that I would have a next due of XXXX/XXXX/15 when it was completed for about {$300.00}. He said it would take a few days to be completed. I then received another collections call at XXXX EST and I returned the call at XXXX CST. I advised the rep of my call with the supervisor and they claimed to not see the notes. I immediately requested a supervisor because now I felt I was being given the runaround, not to mention I work in a call center and was having to leave the floor to return these calls. I was transferred to a XXXX who apologized stating he did n't see the request in the system by XXXX to repost the funds to my payments. He assured me that he would have it taken care of and that it would take a few days. He said that he would note the system and stop any collections calls during this process.

123209,Student loan,"I asked for an audit done on my federal student loan accounts with navient two weeks ago. I asked for the audit because of recent events and because I can not see on any statement how interest is applied to my account. I can see an interest rate and simply that there is interest being applied for each loan. When I asked for an amortization calendar, they refused to provide it and gave me a calculation to show how interest should be applied. What is so infuriating is that I know that any other type of loan would show me specifically how interest is applied month over month ( mortgage, credit card, auto loan, etc ). What makes it okay to take advantage of young people coming out of college? 

An additional concern is that in the past I could apply extra funds in my payments to specific loans within my account. This is n't the case anymore. Whatever lump sum i pay in addition to my bill is distributed by them, so I literally have no idea how that money is applied. They say it 's applied to fees first, then interest, then principle. They have never provided a statement of those payments after I made them though, so it is unknown how much is being paid where and if I 'm paying future interest charges or if I 'm taking care of my principle. 

Please hold them accountable to do the right thing. I work for a financial institution and have been lucky enough to have a good job with great pay, and I 'm still watching my student loans not go anywhere. I 've only been out of school for 6 years and the tax protections for writing off student loan interest do n't apply to me because of my income level, yet, I ca n't seem to make dents into my student loans. 

Please help me get information on my loans and audit navient to ensure they are applying payments correctly."

When her CBR was run, her score had dropped significantly due to B of A reporting the balance I carry on her credit report as if she was carrying the balance. We had not authorized B of A to report on her CBR, my balance was shown on her report thereby violating my privacy ( I did not want my info for other 's to review on her report ), and the resulting drop in her score resulted in a XXXX basis point increase in her refinance rate ( which will cost app {$50000.00} over the life of her loan ). I addressed this with B of A through a number of channels, was initially told they ca n't do anything, then was told it was up to the CBR ( which I called and they affirmed they were only reporting as B of A submitted ), then was told I need to remove her as a user but her report would then show as account closed. I then submitted a complaint and finally was told they would remove the info from her CBRs, but it will take 60 days. She really needs to refinance now ; because of B of A her rate is higher, B of A should not have reported this on her CBR, should not have disclosed my info on her CBR, and should have not either lied or given me incorrect information through a rep, the rep 's supervisor, that supervisor 's supervisor, and finally the dept answering my complaint.

The payment, I was told, was not considered late until the XXXX so we set it up on the XXXX. It was taken out this way for years. The mortgage was sold to Green Tree Servicing ( now XXXX ) back in XXXX of this year. I called them and asked if I could set the mortgage payment set up to be auto drafted on the XXXX as we had done with XXXX. They said that would be fine. I asked if the payment would be late, and they assured me that it would not be if it was paid by the XXXX. Almost every month since XXXX XXXX XXXX has had this account, someone from their organization calls me wanting to know when we will be making our mortgage payment. I have had to call almost every month to explain that we have our payment set up as an auto draft and why are they calling? They usually say they are sorry and that they will not be calling in the future. Starting yesterday I started getting calls once again from XXXX and quite frankly I am at the end of my rope. We have NEVER BEEN LATE WITH THESE PEOPLE yet they do not seem to get the message that we have this payment set up to be auto drafted out of our account, which it has been every month on the XXXX, and that I do not want to be called about a payment that is automatic. I have been told by people at Green Tree Servicing that they should not be calling me and that the calls would stop. Yet, they never do. I do not know what else to do about this and I am so frustrated that I can feel my XXXX XXXX going up whenever I see their number on our caller ID.

I have had MANY arguments with them about how they were not saving us money and they argued if they were wrong, they would have to refund me every single fee, so they were right because they were n't going to. They performed an audit to try and prove they were saving us money. They have very often been late on making our mortgage payments, not 'on the books ' late, but when we signed up our contract said our mortgage is due ON the XXXX of every month. No the XXXX or XXXX. Now on XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter in the mail saying my account is suspended and they have {$680.00} of our money. They will not answer their phones and our mortgage payment is due tomorrow and we do n't know what to do. We feel we are entitled to at least every single fee we have ever paid them, including weekly fees, and of course we want to cancel because this letter shows how irresponsible they are. Plus they have our money and wo n't answer the phone. It literally hangs up on you. I emailed them and my emails bounced back. What do I do??? Please help."

She is no longer able to live independently and currently lives with my parents. I attempted to contact her Reverse Mortgage company well over 15 times in the last two months to find out what the interest is and the total she owes. After being "" disconnected '', transferred multiple times and being told someone would call him back, I still did not have the amount owed until the day before the closing of escrow and never received the contract. The amount they indicated my mother owed was {$410000.00} Her home sold for {$600000.00}. I was faced with two options, continue with escrow and have them take {$410000.00} with no justification ( proof of contract ) or identification of interest accrued or discontinue escrow and they move to foreclose ( although property tax and insurance are current ) because she longer resides in the home. If you were to call your traditional lender and ask them today what you owe on your mortgage, they would provide it to you with no problem. The refusal to provide ( although I am legally entitled as my mother 's Executor of her Estate ) is baffling. They still have not provided documentation. The question remains, if they have nothing to hide and are on the up and up, why not provide the contract? I would implore anyone to not take out a reverse mortgage and strongly discourage anyone they know from taking one out."

I have deposited many checks from the same issuer in the past and have never had a hold placed on one until now. I called Wells Fargo and they advised me they could not remove the hold because the funds were not verifiable. I explained to them I have deposited many of these checks in the past and this is the first time they have placed a hold on one. They told me to call the issuer and verify funds are there. I did just that. I called XXXX and sent email ( see attached ) and funds are present to cash the check. I called Wells Fargo back and they said they still ca n't remove the hold from the account. I told them I felt as if they are doing this now because I have a negative balance and they just want to collect more fees from me. I have been with Wells for 20 years and have never had this issue. I sent email to XXXX and advised them the bank was saying the funds are still not verifiable. I then went into a branch office. The supervisor there told me she called XXXX and they banker would not verify funds available. She told me she would waive XXXX in fees. I then asked why they are placing a hold of nine days or more on this one check. She repeated that they could not verifiy funds. I advised the accounting folks at XXXX and again they are advising me the check shows as cashed on their end and cleared the account. Whom am I to believe at this point? The company who stands to gain from my misfortune in overdraft fees or the company who issued the check? I am still getting fees from Wells Fargo and plan to close all six accounts with them. I need to know why they can hold my money after the issuer confirms it has cleared their account? They are only doing this as policy to collect additional charges. A customer service specialist I spoke to stopped just short of agreeing they are doing this to just collect more in fees. See emails and copy of check attached.

762220,Credit card,"Capitol One MasterCard Statements are lacking proper and minimum disclosure of pertinent information and in my opinion have unacceptable and possibly illegal business practices as the deception is clearly intentional. Other major credit card companies have this information on them and for good reason, Cap One does not. 
Lack of proper disclosure of this particular information directly triggers a charge of a high monthly late fee {$35.00} and an increase in rate to nearly 30 %. Due to this and the obvious and evident outrageous attempt of Capitol One to keep hidden select data ( when a Past due is occurring ), it is clear that this lack of disclosure and the corresponding customer service training has been intentionally engineered to originate revenue from unknowing credit card holders at the expense of the client with their credit rating ( 7 yr derog ) in balance The information in question that has been intentionally hidden on their statements, in their email correspondence and on their website is as follows : A reasonable person would not be able to ascertain, even with all statements in front of them and emails, a ) if they were delinquent currently, b ) how much was delinquent c ) the date the past due amount became delinquent. Additionally, the Customer Representatives at Capitol One are most certainly trained to "" wash over '' the subject as complaints come in, it was very obvious that the Supervisor XXXX ID # XXXX got these complaints all day long and I brought that up on the phone. She agreed. Phone calls are recorded at Capitol One. I had to ask simple questions as to whether or not, and when, delinquency notices were sent 4 or 5 times and got different answers each time and got the same run around with almost every reasonable question. At the end she finally agreed that they do not send past due notices and that the reason the pertinent and furthermore misleading information was not on statements was due to the fact that they feel they have provided proper notification of delinquency by simply changing the color to red on the top bar of the statement ( still without the words "" Account is past due, Amount Past due, dates ... on statement, emails, web ). Later, I spoke with her superior who was present on the call with her ( he talked over her ), XXXX, ID # XXXX. 
These are my requests : Please have Capitol One add on the fine print in their statement the CFPB complaint contact information. 
Please have Cap One put the words "" Amount Past Due '' and the respective past due balance on their statements ( when an account is past due ), in their email correspondence and on their website for account holders. 
Please have Cap One put the words "" Account is Past Due '' where/when applicable on their monthly statements, email correspondence and on website clearly and without ambiguity in top left quadrant of statement ( where the red bar is ). 
Please have Cap One reword their emails with email statement link to read "" Account Past Due '' and Payment Due Now and Amount to bring current '' in the text portion of the monthly statement emails when an account is past due. 
Please have Cap One send out delinquency notices when an account is at least 30 days past due via email and through the mail. Not Statement emails, separate notices that specifically read "" Account past due '' and the amount needed to bring account current. 
Over limit Notifications : All of the above, please have Cap One also disclose as outlined above whenever there is an over limit occurrence and it should be generated the day the overage occurs. 
Rate Increases : All of the above, please have Cap One also disclose as outlined above whenever there is a rate increase and the notice should be sent/emailed the same that that the increase takes place. ( Just like with mortgage loans! ) Again, please protect us from these intentionally deceptive business practices of Cap One."

The XXXX Hospital intake form collected XXXX separate options to contact me, yet I was falsely reported delinquent on a balance of {$120.00} ( less than 2 % ) of my bill, without ever being asked for payment. 

When I asked ( PMS ) to validate the debt, they sent me a master account query from XXXX XXXX dated XXXX clearly showing that for my bill totaling {$7000.00} XXXX received 100 % of invoiced amounts within 30 days of the visit : XXXX - {$250.00} copay at the time of service XX/XX/2015 - {$2500.00} deduction XX/XX/2015 - {$4100.00} from my insurance company While 20 years of excellent credit worthiness means more to me than anyone else, I am disheartened to learn that neither XXXX Hospital nor their debt collection agency PMS value a 20 year reputation above the cost of a letter, email or phone call alerting me to the debt ; any of which would have resulted in prompt payment of the {$120.00} bill.

The next morning, XXXX the XXXX, when I got to work at XXXX I went online and checked my balance and transactions. It still said I had a balance of {$380.00}.

That transaction was not on my statement in the morning. They hit me with XXXX overdraft fees. They did it after I transferred the {$1200.00}. I 've noticed some variances in my account before.

According to my text banking the {$100.00} check was posted on the XXXX. But according to my online banking that check was cashed on the XXXX and the check for {$160.00} was cashed on the XXXX. Not to mention that I can not verify what the balance of my account was after each transaction because their online banking is formatted in such a way that it wont allow. It is simply a list of debits and credits and a total at the top. I really feel that Wells Fargo is choosing what dates they want things to post to get more money in fees. I went to the manager and he was unwilling to do anything to help me. I would really appreciate it if someone would look into this. This is predatory, greedy behavior.

Why was n't this done 3 weeks ago? If it takes them another 30 days to release funds to us ( which they inform us is possible ) that means we will be out of our home for over 4 months before we can begin repairs so that we can even move back in.

After I called the Department of Education on this loan and was told it went into default. I spoke to them about bringing it out of default and said they would send me a Hardship Form. As it turns out it was a deferment form so I called again and they said to just send what I could. Within a few days the Department od Education apparently placed this account into collections with a company called FMS. This company called me 5 times over the next five days and I told them not to call me anymore. I requested they only contact me in writing after checking their records of consumer complaints. 
Now the original amount of the loan was {$41000.00} interest due on this Parent Plus loan to date is {$4500.00}. FMS added {$11000.00} to the amount owed to DOE! How is that even possible, I almost had a XXXX when I got this letter. How is this possible that within one week I could go from owing {$45000.00} to {$57000.00}? 
Please help me straighten this out as this company is not going to treat me in a fair manner, at least that is my first impression. I would be happy to supply you a copy of their letter. I was going to send a certified letter to dispute the {$57000.00}, please advise. 
thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX. 


These fees can not possibly be legal and the cavalier manner in which the DOE just forwarded this account to a collection company is not right. I have formal payment plans with the Internal Revenue Service and the State of NJ for back taxes while I was in the hospital and recovering. The treatment I received from both agencies was far better then this situation. FMS was constantly auto-dialing me at all hours of the day and evening. I have written times and various numbers they called from. Sometimes as late as XXXX."

So, please tell me this company reports information accurately and timely. If you would like all of this documented evidence, I am happy to send it to you, but it 's all pretty thick. I appreciate your help in ending this as it 's not fair and AHFC had not followed the law in marking my file 1. in dispute and 2. responding in a timely manner. This type of reporting is for a reason, and when at fault, I am happy to take my due punishment. However, this reporting is not accurate and AHFC has done nothing according to the law to correct this error or follow the law in investigating, marking the file as in dispute and NOT continuing to write derogatory marks on my file as payback for fighting them on this.

OOA XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX I contacted AMEX and complained. I was informed I should 1. Pay my bill on time 2. Read the fine print in the contract. I asked for a Supervisor. 
I informed AMEX I wanted the account cancelled and a total for a final amount so I could pay it. At that time I was told the final amount was {$740.00}. I specifically asked if there are any additional "" hidden fees AMEX is going to attempt to XXXX me on ... ''.

XXXX agreed to wave the {$3.00} charge and said she was sorry. As of this writing ( XXXX XXXX 2016 ) the charge still pends. 
Throughout the entire process I was given conflicting, contradictory and false information by AMEX personnel. I was outright lied to by AMEX personnel and Supervisors ( XXXX ) by them agreeing to assist me then not following through with what they said they would. Additionally, AMEX personnel claimed events that were simply impossible by citing incorrect dates and corporate policy that I felt they made up as they went.

383345,Mortgage,"I was contacted by phone by my current Mortgage Lender indicating that they wanted to offer me a lower interest rate, which they said would reduce my current payment with no out of pocket additional cost to me. I was making my mortgage payment and paying an additional ( approx ) escrow payment of {$410.00} on a monthly basis. This additional payment led to about approx {$4500.00} being in the escrow account at the time that the Mortgage Lender called me. My home is a new construction, and XXXX will be the first year that the land and home have been appraised. At my original closing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, it was suggested that I put in extra money in my escrow account to make up for the short-fall that would occur when my XXXX taxes would be due. During our conversations ( which are all recorded by the mortgage lender ) we discussed what would happen to the accumulated escrowed additional monies that we had XXXX the {$4500.00} XXXX - and we were told that we would either receive a check for those funds, or that the escrow would be rolled over to the new escrow account. At NO TIME EVER was any mention made that the escrow funds would be used to pay down the current mortgage principal ( thereby making the principal lower so that they could fraudulently tell us that they could "" lower '' our payments ). After closing on the new loan, and us calling them ( prior to the three days "" cooling off '' period ) - we inquired about what happened to our {$4500.00} escrowed monies, we were told that we had to call back to discuss this AFTER the new loan was processed and the cooling off period was expired. Once we were able to talk to an agent, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, we were told that our escrowed funds of {$4500.00} was used to pay the closing costs on the loan and the remainder applied to the principal reduction, and we would receive a check for {$44.00}. We have made numerous attempts to contact the company to resolve this to no avail and they have not returned our calls. Had we been informed that our escrowed money ( that was earmarked for the XXXX property taxes ) would actually be used for closing costs and principal reduction - we would NEVER have agreed to refinance our mortgage loan. Our monthly payments ( to make up for this now shortfall of funds for our taxes ) will now increase our monthly payments by about {$600.00} a month. We were deceived by their dishonest practices."
98438,Mortgage,"My complaint is with CALIBER HOME LOANS. We bought our home in XXXX. Our mortgage was with XXXX XXXX and then XXXX. With XXXX, in XXXX, my husband incurred an injury that required surgery and recovery time. During that time we never missed a mortgage payment. However we did miss a quarterly property tax payment. In XXXX XXXX XXXX sent us a letter that we had defaulted on our loan. We contacted them immediately to work out a way to catch up on the taxes ( still continuing to pay the mortgage payment ). At the time, they were very nice saying they had a whole department to help people like us and they would work with us to give us a loan modification. 
I submitted all paperwork and I continued to pay my monthly mortgage. In XXXX XXXX, XXXX told me to stop paying my mortgage. They said I no longer had a loan and my payments were not going toward my house. They never returned any payments I made either. I stopped paying. 
This dragged out for years as I was shifted to different people. With every shift I would start all over again. They still sent me monthly statements. XXXX I tried to pay my bill ( to show that I could and wanted to. ) They refused my payment XXXX times. 
After ups and downs and a meeting with the court, XXXX led me to believe I had fulfilled all their requirements, I had showed them I could afford the house and they said I could expect a loan modification in about a month. That never happened and XXXX XXXX, they informed me the were selling my house on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. After communications with our lawyer they canceled that sale date and for the first time XXXX sent us to the underwriter under HAMP guidelines. They said we should have a new loan within 14 days. 
Before the underwriter could complete the process, our loan was abruptly sold to CALIBER HOME LOANS. CALIBER said that they do n't participate in the HAMP loan program and promptly set a new sale date for our home of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. CALIBER sent me a letter on XXXX XXXX saying it was my right to request an independent review and during that time they could not continue foreclosure proceedings until the independent reviewer had made a determination. I immediately faxed them that that request. They received it and canceled the sale date. 
However on XXXX XXXX they set a new sale date of XXXX XXXX. I called them and said I had stopped the sale date and the foreclosure proceedings with an independent review ( they would n't tell me who was conducting the independent review ). I said surely they could not have conducted and made a determination between the letter they sent on the XXXX and the schedule of the new sale date on the XXXX??? They then said, actually, while they have a record of me faxing something over to them on XXXX XXXX, they could n't find my request for an independent review so none was being conducted and they were selling my house. I said, "" but I stopped the XXXX XXXX sale with exercising my right to an independent review! If you got nothing, why did n't you sell my house on the XXXX?? '' The "" supervisor '' on the phone said he did n't know why they canceled the sale date. He said there was something in the notes about an appeal of the denial but he said, "" We are selling your house on the XXXX. There is nothing you can do ''. 
So on XXXX XXXX, I filed Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy to stop the sale. CALIBER has done nothing but lie and deny. They wo n't return calls, they loose paperwork, and they will not tell us who owns our note. They changed our monthly mortgage payment from {$2100.00} ( XXXX in XXXX XXXX ) to {$5700.00} ( CALIBER in XXXX XXXX ) but wo n't say why even though all our paperwork says our loan will not change even when the servicer changes. They gave me a primary contact person but he is never available to talk to and he wo n't return my calls. They do n't want my payments. They want my house."

I started a mortgage modification process with XXXX almost 2 years now. while going through the modification process, XXXX apparently sold my mortgage to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing with a P.O. in XXXX MI. 
I was n't very comfortable with how the process was proceeding so I requested to resume my payments to avoid further delinquency while we get the modification finalized. they returned my payments stating they can not accept payments while going through the modification process. 

here is the problems i 'm currently going through. repeatedly sent loan modification documents for 1.5 yrs now. bank keeps asking for more documents or claim they have not received documents sent. 
I engaged the assistance of a mortgage counselor just to ensure that the problem was n't with me. we gathered the documents requested, but every time we 've been to court they indicate to the judge that they are still missing documents. 
most recently I received an email from their attorney that my modification was declined because they did not get the information requested or there are documents provided in non pdf format and they could not view. when I saw the list of items they claim they did not get, it was the 1st time ever seeing them. in addition, I 've been submitting scanned documents in jpeg format for quite some time so not certain why after all this time they are not able to view. all this after receiving a letter from them on XX/XX/2017 that they 've "" received your complete request for a loss mitigation program '', and they are currently reviewing the package to determine if the referenced loan qualifies for one of their programs. the notice i got from their attorney that they are missing information was on XX/XX/2017. 
I 'm now submitting a request for an Order of Mediation with the courts, but I fear that the bank will continue with the same practice of not really evaluating the application while my principal balance continue to balloon. 

Please help.

On XX/XX/XXXX..Chase sends me a Foreclosure Notice and a Sale Date of XX/XX/XXXX from Fla.from the Foreclosure Dept. This is a "" serious '' violation of the XX/XX/XXXX RESPA ( Regulation X ) Mortgage Servicing Rules. According to CFPB "" dual tracking '' is when a mortgage lender or servicer simultaneously is evaluating a Consumer for a loan modification or alternatives at the same time that if prepares to foreclose on the property.

After she passed I called Discover to inform them of her passing. They told me that she did not have this death benefit, even though they told my mom she did. I sent the death certificate in as requested and immediately received a letter stating the full balance was due immediately. My mom sold everything in the months prior to her death.

584569,Mortgage,"My fixed rate 20 year mortgage originated with XXXX, was transferred to XXXX XXXX in a takeover/buyout and is now held by BB & T bank. Since the bank buyout transition in XXXX 2016 my mortgage statements have been riddled with irregularities, the worst of which, is that my 'Outstanding Principal Balance ' has n't gone down since XXXX, even though they have taken 3 payments since then. The most recent statement indicated that 100 % of the payment made was allocated to Interest and 0 % to Principal. What alerted me to the problem was that the "" Explanation of Amount Due '' fluctuated irrationally from statement to statement and did not correlate with the "" Transaction Activity '' after the payment had been processed. To try to resolve the issue, I went to a local bank branch and called the main number. No one seems to know what is going on, and I am certain it is not an isolated case pertaining to only my loan."
185476,Mortgage,"Was contacted by my mortgage company, who offered to lower my interest rate at no cost to me. After a couple of phone calls, I realized I was actually "" re-financing '' my mortgage, not just lowering my current interest rate. I felt this was very deceptive. The first person I spoke to sent me to another person who said she would be my point of contact through out the process. This did n't happen. At every step of the way I was given another "" contact '' who would be with me "" through out the process ''. After explaining to several "" contacts '' that I did not want to finance more than my current principal balance I received my first closing disclosure. This doc was incorrect because they added money to the principal, which I had already explained to several of my "" contacts '' I would rather pay for than finance. I was told the docs would be fixed. They then showed up at the closing with the wrong version of the docs. The closing did n't happen. A second closing was scheduled. Another set of closing disclosure docs were prepared. These docs added even more money to the principal which I explained again to my newest "" contact '' was n't acceptable to me. After spending 45 mins on the phone with my latest "" Contact '', I thought I had finally made the point that I was trying to make all along. I wanted to only finance what my current principal balance was, and would pay for the additional moneys required to payoff the current loan. I was told this would be the interest amount from the XXXX of the month to the date of closing. They would still pay all closing costs. Second disclosures showed up. Once again incorrect. I was told to keep my scheduled closing date as a new set of docs would be drawn up in time for this closing. I never received this third version until the actual day of the closing and yet again the principal amount was now even more. 
I am now stuck. If I do n't close I 'm going to have late fees for missed mortgage payments. The missed payments were because my "" contact '' told me not to pay them as they would be taken care of once the new loan was closed, which did n't happen. The aggravation of having to explain myself over and over to many different "" contacts '' and none of them actually doing it the way I wanted makes me feel like they are trying to scam me out more money than necessary. I do n't want to close this loan but I am now on the hook for late fees. So either way, the 're getting more money out of me than was necessary."

I even sent a letter where the payments cleared my bank. They call MULTIPLE times during work hours to a cell phone at work after explicitly telling them not to call that number. They still call.

Wells did not meet their published timelines not the constant assurances from XXXX XXXX ( Wells Fargo single point of contact ).

We sent them a complete package of all of the documentation including the paid bill and credit card resolution. They simply sent an inquiry to the debt collector who said the account was valid and had not been paid without reviewing the documentation which showed the debt should never have been sent to the debt collector as the merchant did not respond to the credit card company 's inquiry about our dispute or send us anything once the case was resolved, and the debt collector did not do due diligence when the information was provided to them.

When I received my BestBuy statement in XX/XX/XXXX there was a charge for {$29.00} for IPAD software, I immediately called BestBuy customer service and told them the IPAD was cancelled and questioned why the charge was on my account. I was told it would be corrected. I received a statement in XX/XX/XXXX and the charge was still on there, again I called customer service and this time questioned why it was n't removed, and asked why it was on there in the first place being that I ordered an IPAD initially which was never on my statement yet I was being charged for some software that went with the IPAD. I was informed once again the problem would be corrected. Well, I received a statement in XX/XX/XXXX that still had the charge on it only this time it stated my account was past due ( This was the ONLY charge on my account and I did not feel I should pay for something I did not charge or receive ). I again called customer service and demanded the issue be resolved and complained that I had spent literally hours on the phone with customer service trying to resolve a charge that I never should of had on my account, again I was told it would be resolved. When I received my XX/XX/XXXX statement the balance was once again at XXXX and I assumed the charge was indeed corrected .... Only to find out years later that was n't the case. 
I recently had my credit score ran and when reviewing the results I had XXXX late payment out of XXXX payments made. When I saw who the late payment was from I was very upset ... BestBuy, for not making a payment XX/XX/XXXX for a charge that NEVER should of been on my account. I immediately called BestBuy credit services to have this removed because I did n't feel my credit report accurately reflected my BestBuy account, you can see the history was ALWAYS paid on time and that there was no payment made by me in XX/XX/XXXX by me ( the account was credited ). Here 's what I received from BestBuy ... Unfortunately, we are unable to change the information reported to the credit reporting agencies, as it accurately reflects your account history with us. Are you kidding me? 
I called them immediately only to have them say, BestBuy did n't credit your account, we just wrote it off because you 've been a valued credit card holder with BestBuy for XXXX years, and I doing so we ca n't report the account was current. I 'm at a loss ... My initially reaction was to cancel my BestBuy credit card, only to think cancelling a card may also affect my credit score. I know it 's only 1 late payment from XXXX years ago, but it 's the principle of it, BestBuy used words in their letter like "" integrity '' and "" accurately ''.

Well another bank sent me there I did n't just go to the front of the line. I then asked her why she was getting Nasty her tone was very rude, when another teller by the name of XXXX jumped right in our conversation and the rep at the business counter that was assisting the customer jumped in the conversation as well. I believe her name is XXXX it was hard for me to see her name tag. They were unprofessional arguing in front of other customers with me until another older lady in line came and told them she agreed with me. They started going back and forth with her as well.

403093,Consumer Loan,"Honda Financial Services XXXX misapplied car loan payment to a closed lease account. This caused all subsequent payments to be considered late and fined for delinquency.

Honda has made it additionally difficult to rectify this matter as they are only open XXXX - XXXX and will not allow clients to speak with supervisors when calling Customer Support.

583091,Mortgage,"A few years ago I was heavily solicited by a Wells Fargo mortgage consultant, XXXX XXXX, to refinance a rental property I own in XXXX. I explained to her on several occasions that I had no interest due to the changes in mortgage insurance ( 1.2 to 1.55 % for the life of the loan vs XXXX until the loan reached XXXX loan to value ). She continued to aggressively pursue me stating that I can do a streamline FHA and not change my MI. Stating, "" There are a lot of people who are n't familiar with this guideline since there is very few people fit the criteria. '' On multiple occasions I explained to her that I do n't like surprises and to fully disclose. She specifically told me that there were no gotchas and once I reached XXXX loan to value I could call Wells Fargo and drop the mortgage insurance. 

A couple months ago I reached out to Wells Fargo to drop the MI and they told me that when I refinanced my loan that the time period in which I would be required to keep mortgage insurance was extended by 5 years. Thus, costing me XXXX of dollars. I have been fighting with them for months and they are unwilling to help until I threatened to contact you, CFPB. 

Here is my complaint:1 ) Had they fully disclosed the timeframe in which I had to keep MI I would have been able to make more informed decision. Likely would have written a check to get the loan to XXXX to prevent this or forgo the loan entirely. 

2 ) My original loan was with Wells Fargo and my refinance was also with Wells Fargo and mortgages are a very complicated financial instrument. How can we allow firms like this to do predatory soliciting that is n't in the best interest of the consumer especially post 2008? The mortgage consultant had access to my old mortgage and knowingly convinced me to refinance even though it was n't in my best interest - thats should be fraud.

263997,Bank account or service,"After moving to Florida on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for new employment with XXXX XXXX XXXX, I opened up a new checking and savings account with Bank of America on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to secure my future deposits. The initial deposit of {$3600.00} which was a combination of my salaried payout and my relocation signing bonus were deposited into my account. I from their made several miscellaneous purchases i.e. bills, presents for my wife and children, and etc. However, the point at why I am writing you all started on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I made a payment directly to XXXX on their online website for {$450.00} for a XXXX payment due date. Note : Yes, I at this time was behind in payments, yet the {$450.00} would most definitely start me off to paying the XXXX and XXXX payment sooner and on time in the month of XXXX. I am paid every two weeks and a bonus every last day of each month..so I personally would have paid the next XXXX payments on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX or XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. These dates would 've ensured my account current at any rate going into XXXX. ) I foolishly thought my bank 's Bill Pay Service was an autonomous and secure way of making sure I could stay abreast on my bills, so I resulted in scheduling through their Bank of America Mobile Bank App a bill payment for {$410.00} ( the normally arranged payment for XXXX ) on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This was the only payment arrangement I pre-set and only set as a recurring payment for the XXXX of each month. Monday morning XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX in a retail location I attempted to swipe my card for {$50.00} and was declined several times. I right then checked my account on my app and witnessed my account in the negative for the amount of {$1200.00} ; which is a total of {$450.00}, {$410.00}, & XXXX. This resulted in a immediate call to Bank of America hours later that morning, while the XXXX {$410.00} payments were still processing I called to inform Bank of America 's Bill Payment Department that these were done in error and not scheduled by me, and since they are pending, to stop payment on these ACH 's. I recall very clearly that they seconded that suggestion of stop payments and that they did in fact notice that was n't my original payment schedule and hence figured it was wrong due to the 4 days earlier payment of {$450.00}. To bring this to head ... it has been 3 1/2 weeks later and I have not been refunded because Bank of America has totally disregarded me as individual who job is at jeopardy because they 've misused my relocation money, put me in default with my XXXX relationship because instead of returning the {$830.00} ( XXXX ) {$410.00} 's they 've returned and not paid the {$450.00} I submitted from the beginning, I have had my car insurance cancel from XXXX because I have not had the funds to cover, the over drafted account had cut my recent pay in half, ate up a {$120.00} refund, {$180.00} transfer from my outside account, and numerous fees and emotional distress. As a direct result, I am sending this message inside my car, of which I have been staying in if my family has not been able to assist buying me cheap hotel stays. Living in my car as a XXXX is not only warranted as improper, but inhumane due to being bamboozled by deceptive practices.

171892,Bank account or service,"Wells Fargo used overdraft protection to pay a XXXX phone bill that was not yet due. I had {$9.00} in my account when the bill came in for {$250.00} a few days before the due date. This had happened in the past where XXXX tried to take the payment early. If the money was not there, Wells Fargo did not pay it and there were no penalties from either entity, they would then deduct the payment on my actual due date after informing me that there would be a one time payment of what the amount was for that month. I waited at the bank for almost two hours while a banker ran back and forth between the manager and myself. I never saw the manager although there were XXXX in the building. Upon calling the fraud department shortly after leaving that branch I discovered nothing had been done. She told me my account needed to be frozen and I was under the impression she was actually doing that when I was in front of her. I explained my claim to the fraud department and double checked that my accounts were frozen. I was told they would be frozen during the claim period and I would be contacted in 10 days to 2 weeks. The over draft department kept contacting me. I told them about the claim. They said they can not see that there is a claim on my account because they use different computer systems. That makes no sense. They kept calling me through the month and when I asked them to transfer me to the fraud department after a couple of weeks, that is when I found out that my claim had been closed. No one had called me. They denied my claim and offered me XXXX % of XXXX overdraft charges! This was not my doing to begin with and they offer me XXXX? I made an appointment and went to speak with a banker. She got the manager so I could explain it yet again to another Wells Fargo employee. She said that it is mandatory overrdraft protection and they could pay what they wanted at their discretion and best judgement. I asked her how that was in good judgement. I had {$9.00} and they paid out {$250.00}. They never paid it before. During the claim period Wells Fargo emptied my accounts. Their explanation that they were trying to cover the negative balance of several hundred dollars with {$80.00} is just stupid. There was not much in them but they took my savings, the debit account they had told me I was required to have, that I had to pay monthly fees on, AND my pre-paid Visa card account. Oh, they never put a hold or a freeze on my account. Never, even though I verified it. The manager and banker tell me oh there should have been a freeze on the account!!!! I asked them to deduct all of the fees that happened after they supposedly put the freeze on the account. The manager actually suggested that I go talk to the first girl I spoke to. I was pretty upset at this point. I do n't have the luxury of time, I have to work or I cant survive. This took hours out of my work time. They got me to leave by saying that they would look in to deducting all the charges after the freeze and would call me in a day or two. I also at this point had a message in with the fraud/claims department to have a manager call me. No one ever called me back. They ruined my credit, took all of the few dollars I had and wrote me off. Banks are supposed to protect our money, right? I am dumbfounded. Talking to a Wells Fargo employee is as effective as talking to a wall, but way more frustrating. I want my accounts back with the balances where they were. I almost told them that I would not worry about the stuff prior to the date the Freeze was supposed to be put on my account. But no way! I do not need to pay for their mistakes.

138660,Mortgage,"I have had many dealings with property mortgages over the years and none as frustrating or lacking professionalism and honesty as my dealings with Bank of the West on my current loan. 
We have had loan amounts switched at the last minutes, delays and lies told to us about why the delays are happening, we have been ignored by supervisors when we tried to bring these to their attention, we have been strung along with a promise of closing only to find out that the bank is not ready yet. We have been asked to go above and beyond the responsibilities of a borrowing for example, when they asked us to acquire a form from the building and safety office, that neither Bank of the West understood not did I. Without understanding what underwriting wanted how could we be expected to satisfy their condition. In the end I contacted the city directly and resolved the issue but this was after numerous calls and all because the bank refused to explain what the appraisal department wanted. With regards to this particular issue we were told we would receive a link to file the form that day, and when i followed up a week later he had just sent it. This delayed our closing another week. This is just one example of us being told we would receive things within a day or so and not received anything until a week later, further holding up the closing of our loan. 
Yesterday I was told by an assistant to my loan advisor at Bank of the West that this is the XXXX loan and the XXXX loan was cancelled because some documents were not provided within a specific time frame. This was a complete surprise to me as I am very responsive with everything the bank requested and was never made aware that a new loan had been opened or why this had happened. When I asked what documents had not been provided and explained that I had no knowledge of a new loan, she feigned ignorance and told me she did n't have any more information although she had access to our loan in her system. 

XX/XX/XXXX I made my loan officer aware that I had a vacation planned for the end of the month. he assured me we would sign documents by XX/XX/XXXX and that the loan would not interfere with the vacation plans I made. The XXXX came and went and the bank still was not ready with documents. They gave me the run around and their answer was always "" just a couple of days more ''. finally XX/XX/XXXX I realized that the loan was going to take another week or so to close so I executed a power of attorney so that my co-borrower could sign the documents at escrow for me. I then left the country and was told that we would close within a week. I left town on XX/XX/XXXX and returned on XX/XX/XXXX and the loan documents have still not been ordered. My loan agent left the country and did not pass off my loan to anyone else. When I contacted the bank on XX/XX/XXXX I found out that loan disclosures still needed to be signed. This was a surprise to me because I had signed several pages of disclosures on XXXX per my loan agent and sent them to him via email on that day. He told me that the rest of the disclosures could be signed at closing. So imagine my shock when i was informed that documents had not been ordered for two weeks because they were missing disclosures. I forwarded the original email to his assistant with the date stamp so she could see that I had handled this on XX/XX/XXXX. I also left a voice message for their supervisor and sent several emails. I have had no response as of today. 
There are just a few of the examples that I have. I have never dealt with a bank that had mislead me and it has caused great frustration on my part. I am at my wits end so I am writing this complaint in the hopes of getting the attention of someone at the Bank so that my loan can close. 
My loan agent is XXXX XXXX and his supervisor is XXXX XXXX. Neither have contacted me in over a week."

I spoke to a representative named XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and offered to settle the account for {$1200.00} even though I dispute the account. I notified them of the improper service and they could n't do anything to help find a reasonable resolution to my complaint of improper service and my dispute with the fees and interest. They gave me a counter offer of XXXX on a balance that they state I owe of {$6400.00}. I am unable to do that amount. My financial situation will not allow for it. I am a single parent of XXXX children. And I am barely living paycheck to paycheck. I have also notified them to not contact me by telephone and to cease and desist calling me. At this time since they have not investigated the improper service they are causing me undue hardship by garnishing my bank account and refusing to come to a reasonable resolution. I am in fear that they will garnish my paycheck next. And because of my low income I will have another hardship if I have to hire an attorney to file motions to quash the judgement for improper service or risk representing myself. I believe it is unfair and deceptive for them to use improper service to obtain default judgements and I would like your help to resolve the issue.

Beginning with the "" XXXX month trial period '' in XXXX, Ocwen started bombarding me with delinquency notices and threatening letters.

I worked with my parents to find the proof and submitted it to Navient XX/XX/XXXX, and they said I would hear back within two weeks regarding their findings.

357113,Student loan,"I 've had a long 7-month battle with Navient over XXXX unconsolidated private student loans I have with them. For years, I have been on an "" interest-only '' payment plan with Navient where my payments were roughly around {$650.00} dollars. I was on this payment plan due to the fact that the interest rates on my loans, ( some as high as 9.5-11.5 % ) make it nearly impossible for me to make a monthly payment on the principal. If I were to make a monthly payment on the principal I would be looking at roughly, {$1500.00} dollars a month for 20 years or so. There is no way humanely possible I could make double the payments on this to start chipping away at the debt, unless by a miracle of God himself where I won the lottery. This is negating the fact that I have other student loans and monthly expenses. I moved back into my parent 's house in XX/XX/XXXX because finding employment in my career field was extremely rough. Since then, I have made small strides and have had little improvements in terms of higher income. My XXXX Degrees were in XXXX which unfortunately does n't allow me to generate the kind of income needed to make a dent in these loans. 
My current base pay is a little over {$40000.00} dollars a year. After constantly battling with Navient in trying to negotiate payment arrangements that I can live with, ( i.e. ) I am turning XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and would like to be able to move out of my parent 's house at some point in my life because they are looking to sell the house and relocate to Florida to retire ) they were unwilling to negotiate with me. As of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I decided to stop paying Navient all together and sought out legal counsel to help negotiate some sort of debt settlement or payment options. The attorney I currently have representing me is the Law Offices of XXXX XXXX XXXX. They have sent out numerous letters of demands requesting the promissory notes on my student loans. The only demand Navient has complied with is that they stopped harassing me with 10 phone calls a day. 
All cellular contact was ceased. However, that does n't stop them from flooding my email inbox with notifications of missed payments, etc. It has been 7 months since I have made a payment to Navient and at the beginning of this journey my credit score was somewhere in the low XXXX range and as of today it is a XXXX. The current amount owed to Navient on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was {$77000.00} and as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX it is now {$82000.00}. I knew once I stopped paying them this would be XXXX of the consequences I would have to deal with. Unfortunately, in my career field, one of the areas that XXXX agencies look at is credit history and credit reports. Not only has these loans hindered and crippled my ability to live independently on my own and start my life, it is has prevented me from advancing in my field of work. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a voice message from XXXX XXXX claiming to be from Navient 's "" internal recovery unit. '' The number that he left for me to call him back at was XXXX. Once I got him on the phone, he informed me that as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX my XXXX unconsolidated private student loans were officially in "" default, file # XXXX. '' He advised me that he was sending me out a letter with the consequences of this situation. I informed XXXX that I have in no way tried avoiding Navient and that I would like to pay back my debt and that I hired an attorney, XXXX XXXX and Associates to represent me in this matter, however Navient has refused to acknowledge him as my legal counsel and has neglected to present him with the appropriate documentation he requested.

Our processor, XXXX XXXX, says that it is the card that determines this. I believe the latter is the case from what I have experienced firsthand.

When I called XXXX XXXX yesterday, I was told that they have not issued Chip and PIN cards in the US, only Chip and Sign cards. When I said that I 'd rather have a PIN to avoid fraud in the first place and make my card truly secure, I was told that Fraud is covered 100 % and not to worry ... How stupid is that?

I contacted the original debtor. I told me they did have my correct address. I informed the company Conserve sent the notice to my old address. I said they had the new address for awhile. The biggest problem is when I informed Conserve. That i never got the notice. I was meet with attitude and bad business ethics. Conserve said it was my fault they had the wrong address and not their in a very angry and discomfort way they told me. As if they was saying we do n't care what we did. The confusing is Conserve some how had my current employer address correct. But had my current address wrong. I started working for this company while after I moved. It seems to be Conserve did this so I could n't fight the claim. I would n't had thought this if someone would had said sorry we had the wrong address. But instead they made it seem like it was my fault trying to be little me or bully me into saying nothing. I felt a lot of discomfort. I felt I like I just got bullied into something and had not control. Cause I was never given my right to settle or make a payment arrangement. I told Conserve they they do n't show up on my credit report. They informed me that they would n't show up. This is what scarred me an outside party is collecting something and there is no paperwork on my credit report of them. I felt like i was be even more bullied. And that the none notice was intentional to collect on a debt before I could stop it. I filled out all their requirements to have the debt lifted. I was told I could fax it in so I did. They said they sent it off to the original debtor to go over to see if the debt can be lifted. I was told I could send in extra information. I sent in extra info later. So I called and was informed they they do n't know if the extra info would be used. They just told me that it would be. So I ask is it a way I can check on it. They told me no.

A trip to the branch could n't even get the initial deposit completed and I had to personally call their XXXX number to get it done. Citibank also had very poor handling of new accounts created online and never sent out any confirmation of account opening. Now come XX/XX/XXXX and I 've been patiently waiting for their bonus which they say they will credit, but they keep sending the issue to research and it is yet unresolved. First they say they do n't have a XXXX form, which I filled out within two weeks of opening the account and handed personally to an account representative at their local branch. That means their online banking entity is completely separate from their branches or their system is so poor that they are n't in sync.

648399,Debt collection,"I have being going through a dispute with Bank of America for a while now in regards to a fraudulent cc. Bank of America is an extremely dishonest organization. I say that because I have more than provided proof that I did not apply for a card. I want to start off by saying after discovering this fraudulent debt, I contacted Bank of America and provided them my address in which I have been at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX almost 10 years. Meaning this is where I was when they claim they sent a card, ask Bank of America, where did they send a credit card to? I have sent them a copy of my property taxes which shows the date I moved in. The time that they state they issued a card it was not sent to my address, review the application. This is the address in which I was located at when the card was issued. If they look at the information on their application, it does not match my address and they know that. Next they indicated, that I signed the application, I never signed a application, did Bank of America see me sign an application, no, nor have I seen an application. Next, they indicated that XXXX my daughter and I shared a bank account in which payments where paid from. Please send the checks or what ever payments were made as I never authorized any payments to the organization, we never shared an account. Then I sent them a letter from XXXX in which they indicated they transferred funding to a XXXX account. When I sent them the document from XXXX indicating the account in which they indicated funds where transferred to was a fraudulent account, Bank of America is indicating that the XXXX letter was referring to a lease when that is a lie, the XXXX letter was indeed a letter in reference to a fraudulent credit card in which they stated about transferring funds to. I have produced documents to show my residence at the time of this credit card. I was not living at the address in which they have. I showed my voter 's registration card to also confirm my address at the time of this card. I have given them a letter from XXXX in which Bank of America lied stating it was a letter for a lease it is not. Please provide me a letter from them so I can sue you and XXXX if they told you that lie. I inquired as to why I was not contacted before issuing credit, because I have had a fraud alert for numerous years including the period of the issuance of this card, they would have been aware I did not apply. Then I have also sent a copy of my XXXX mortgage document, which showed my previous address of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX address which was the address prior to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Residence. This document also has my signature. I have provided more than enough information to show this was fraud. This company needs to remove this fraudulent debt as I have to sue. I can not be responsible for an account I knew nothing of. Then they have the audacity to state I benefitted from it. I never received anything from this organization. This company should have a copy of my license, social security or something to be sure that they are issuing credit to the party on their application. I have no reason to be go through all of this and to be dishonest. During this period my husband and son were XXXX, trust me, the furthest thing from my mind would to be applying for a card with your organization. Perhaps if you go through this horrendous event of your XXXX XXXX XXXX son XXXX and your spouse and then they lose their life, let me know if you would be thinking about applying for a credit card, unbelievable. I pay for what I get, so I have no reason to be dishonest with this company. It 's sad that they know that I did not receive a card and they want to hold me liable, this is unreal. If you have enough proof that XXXX is liable, you hold her liable but I never received, applied or benefitted from anything from your org"
604064,Credit card,"Discover credit card reported late payments to the credit reporting agencies, adversely affecting my credit. 
In XXXX XXXX, my estranged husband violated a standing court order and closed the Discover card which had his name on it, but it had been agreed it was designated for my exclusive use pending the final divorce decree. I was the primary card holder and had the card since XXXX. I called Discover and wanted to reinstate the card and was told that was not possible. I then offered to pay the balance and was told I must wait until the closing of the billing cycle. Since I did everything online, I was told my online access would stay active until the bill was paid in full. In XXXX, I received an email stating my bill was ready online, but my login did n't work. I was unable to login to pay, so I called Discover to pay my bill. I was told that the balance of {$160.00} had been transferred to the other Discover card which my husband had opened in my name as well as his ( again in violation of the court order ). I was told there was no balance to pay. Another month past and I received an email with a bill now past due and including late charges. I again called Discover to pay my bill but not late fees for which I was not responsible. The representative refused to remove the late charges and inferred I was lying about what I was told previously. I was justifiably indignant considering my 25 year history or always paying on time. After "" stewing '' about it a while, I remembered Discover states that calls are recorded. So I again called and I asked the representative to listen to the recording ; I wanted to pay my bill, but not to pay late charges since I had twice tried to pay my balance. The representative returned to the line and she removed the late fees and took my payment information for the original balance of {$160.00}. After sincerely thanking her, I stated I wanted to ensure that my credit score would not be negatively impacted. She said nothing to indicate anything to the contrary. The representative was XXXX XXXX and she provided a reference number of XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I believed this issue was resolved. Several week s later, while resolving account changes associated with the divorce, I received information that my credit score had dropped below XXXX from the usual mid to high XXXX. When I checked I saw Discover was reporting XXXX late payments. I again contacted Discover and was told they could only remove it if it was their fault ( which it clearly was ), but they refused to accept the responsibility, and again started inferring I was lying. I asked them to provide me with the recording or any transcripts of my many calls and they would not. They acknowledge I have called many times since my card was cancelled. They never claim that the calls were attempts to avoid paying or questioning charges. They remain adamant that they wo n't remove the late payment reports. At this time in my life, it is important to have this rectified. Because my former husband is a XXXX and stopped paying his bills, I have had to get all new credit cards, and new utilities at my home and my business, so he can not access and cause more harm. The end result of all the new applications and so many utilities checking my credit is my credit is negatively impacted. This ca n't be avoided, but the worst harm is the Discover reports. It is unrealistic to believe that after 25 years of paying in full on time that I would neglect to pay a {$160.00} bill. I would like Discover to remove the late payment reports. I have received a credit card denial and a letter from XXXX stating that due to my credit report, I did not qualify for discounted programming, activation fee and or equipment."

183378,Consumer Loan,"I have never missed a payment of any kind in my life, and have made over 110 on time payments to my Capital One line of credit. I recently moved from XXXX to XXXX, and have ended up with a late payment issue with Capital One. Here is the sequence of events. I called to change my address and was told that it updated my loan as well, it did not. I realized that I had not received a statement and called to inform Capital One that I would be making a payment, and at that time they updated my address ( XXXX XXXX ). There was a mix up with bill pay and I paid one of my other Capital One accounts. Thinking I was up to date I had no idea that anything was wrong. In the mean time, even though my address was up to date I received no statements alerting me that my account was past due ( I have not received any statements from Capital One ). On XX/XX/XXXX over a week later I received a call from Capital One collections. The caller ID was only a XXXX number with no reference to my financial institution. I answered the phone but heard no response on the other end. I thought it was a solicitation call. Apparently it was Capital One collections. They did not attempt to call right back or to leave a message. I was contacted at least two additional times by Capital One collections, but a message was never left. I feel that a message in this situation is a must. How can someone not leave a message that your account is past due, when you have a perfect paying customer, and have already talked to them, and in your notes you see that they said they were making a payment. I believe this to be very strange. There was another call made to me where I answered and the whole situation was explained to me. I made my payment over the phone, which has still not been posted to my account, and the wrong payment amount was told to me. I would have preferred to pay everything I owed. I also asked for a supervisor to call me back and have not received a response yet. My major concern is that this will effect my perfect payment history on my credit. Capital One had not talk tracks, information, or escalation path to address my concerns. Even if capital one is at fault they will not help you with the reporting of your late payment. They just inform you that they automatically report to the credit bureaus. This is shocking, because I work for the credit bureau, and this drives consumers to have to dispute things directly through their credit report, which is a poor way to handle a situation like this. Capital One needs a clear cut process of how to address consumer credit reporting issues when a consumer believes that capital one is at fault or has a role of responsibility in the circumstances of the issue. I have never been involved with a collections process form any financial institution, but this experience had made me realize that there is no real hope for consumes if something goes wrong, and that the communication of the departments responsible for alerting consumers and collecting depts. is very poor. In addition I am very concerned that there is not an easy way to escalate a situation with capital one, through their website, or speak to anyone above a supervisor at the call center. For someone that has never had an issue with paying, and has fallen into the stressful situation of moving to another state and encountering an issue with updating my information with my financial institution, I need help. From my prospective there is not way to mitigate this situation other that to contact a third party regulatory agency such as the CFPB. I hope that you can assist me with getting Capital One 's attention and resolving my issue, along with protecting the integrity of my credit score which we all know is extremely important, and something I have worked a life time to achieve. Thank you in advance for you assistance."

I proved Bank of America with as much information as I had and answered every one of their questions, On XX/XX/2016 I received all follow-up letter ( see attached ) requesting "" additional information '' without providing that additional information in writing. Since I have family members in law enforcement, one thing I know is at all times have records documented so they can not be misconstrued and always make sure both sides have access to these records. Bank of America seems to demand a taped verbal conversation whereas, they obtain the only copy. However, I have read the complaints all over the internet that Bank of America refuses to be transparent and manipulative. Therefore, i have requested all correspondence in writing to avoid confusion.

403677,Credit card,"I purchased a custom {$970.00} costume from XXXX. The merchant sent a damaged and unusable item. The merchant said she would start a claim with XXXX and send me a prepaid return label to return the damaged item to he and she would give me a refund. I waited day after day and she never sent. I have proof of the text messages of me asking her every day for the label and her ignoring me. I sent records of my phone bill of me trying to contact her and her ignoring me. I filed a claim with the Bank of America and they initially gave me my money back. Then the merchant lied and said she told me I had 3 days to return the item to her on my own. You can see in all her messages that I have from her that that never happened and she told ME to wait on HER sending the prepaid return label. I have pictures of the damaged items that she saw and her response to seeing them. I have all the proof that I need that she sent me damaged goods, claimed she started a fedex claim, ignored me and never sent a prepaid return label and essentially stole my money and left me with damaged goods. She did n't answer any calls or texts and left me to file a dispute against her with credit card company. Where this becomes Bank of America 's fault is they sent me a letter asking for this proof, I have faxed the proof to them twice and have the fax confirmations that both times the faxes went through. They never reviewed any of my proof and sided with the fraudulent merchant. I spoke with XXXX in XXXX and sent the proof to him on XXXX/XXXX/16 when claim was active, I called again when I received a letter saying my claim was denied and spoke to XXXX in XXXX and she said to go to a Bank of America branch and re fax the proof with the confirmation proving that it went through the first time and I did that as well. XXXX at B of A on XXXX XXXX in XXXXXXXX sent it again and AGAIN I got confirmation it went through. XXXX said to call back in 48 hours to make sure it was received and I did that.

I asked to speak to a manager and was put on hold another 10 minutes before an even ruder and less helpful guy named XXXX in Maryland came on. He said I was "" out of luck '' because they did n't receive anything. But really I am out of luck that B of A is incompetent when I have proof they received my faxes twice and did n't bother to review them. How is my bank, my cc company, siding with a woman committing fraud and they wo n't even look at the proof that THEY asked me for. I am disgusted by their incompetence and lack of effort.

Some time ago I was contacted by my realtor and was told that now WellsFargo wanted actual copies of my personal household bills. ( why would they need this since they have my bank statements? ) I was extremely concerned with providing this as I felt that it was an invasion of my privacy not to mention probably against the FDCPA guidelines. I provided it because I was told that they would close my short sale file and move to foreclosure if I did not provide it. The request to short sale has been opened and closed so many times that I have lost count. I understand that they need constant updating of the docs, but if they had n't kept cancelling the file and not advising why, or cancelling it for XXXX reasons, we would n't be having to CONSTANTLY provide them with updated docs.

Most recently I was informed by my realtor that they needed him to remove the listing of the house from the market. As I remember it, the negotiator for the attorney, said that WF said that we needed to list the property as an "" active '' listing in the XXXX at the purchase contract price for 30 days. He did what the bank asked and a few days later he was contacted by the XXXX and was told that he can not list a property "" active '' if there is a pending contract on it, it is against XXXX rules, and that he needed to mark it as contingent again or he would be fined. Why would WF ask the realtor to do something that could potentially get him fined? After a few weeks and none of my attorneys numerous inquiries as to the status of the file, she was finally able to get someone to on the phone, she was notified that the file had been closed because we would not actively market the property in the XXXX. She argued with them and finally got them to re-open the file and here we are now, WF asking for the same information that we have provided for the last year. How is this right! My ex-husband is severely XXXX and all of this is causing him stress that is not necessary. At this point we are out of options as to how to get this resolved.

They obviously spoofed a different business ' number in an effort to trick me into answering the phone. I am of the understanding that this practice is against Federal law, so I want to file a complaint. I will be mailing a Cease & Desist letter tomorrow but I still want to complain about the spoofing. I am retaining a copy of the letter and I am saving the caller id information and voice mail to prove my side of this story."

308858,Student loan,"I took out a private loan while attending XXXX in XXXX PA with XXXX XXXX after being told I had to or go home that night, I was told it was my only option. I signed the documents not knowing or understanding the terms of the loan, i feared i was going to lose everything I had worked for up to that point. When I found out the loans were being charged over 20 % interest after I left school I tried to get them at a lower rate but no banks wanted to touch them. I finally got XXXX XXXX to reduce the rates to 13.5 % but it still was n't enough. I continued to struggle and for 31 months I was unemployed and my only option provided by them was forbearance. When I went back to work I continued to struggle to pay the loan. Fast forward to now and recently I spoke with a manager at the new branch of XXXX XXXX, Navient, name XXXX XXXX. He told me info for the first time that was denied to me for the entire time I was struggling with payments, my original loan amount being the {$21000.00} and that I had paid {$43000.00} on the loan while I was making the payments. He also informed that I currently owed "" a little more than {$26000.00} '', after the initial rep said {$28000.00}, and that I was scheduled to pay {$350.00} a month until XXXX of 2029, this totaled {$100000.00} on the original {$21000.00} loan. I then told him I 'd like to settle but he said I 'd have to make a payment of whatever amount I committed before it would be accepted. I told him I 'd have to see what I could make available and after number crunching the loan amounts the payout on the loan, it would have been a total of {$46000.00} by the initial rates had I been on time and rated at the 10 years I thought it was. I thought I would then offer the difference of ehat i paid and the original loan, was informed it was actually 15 years and it 's been XXXX so I was confused why it was still so high if 6 years from now is the pay off but I 've already paid almost everything? I tried for several days to reach XXXX XXXX but he was unreachable, he called back once after I had left a message saying I 'd be unavailable after a certain time, coincidentally it was during that time. I decided to call the main center they have set up and was continuously told he 'd be on the line soon when a woman named XXXX XXXX picked up. She was n't interested in numbers nor my offer to pay the remainder of the original note citing the forbearance as the reason it once again inflated to XXXX. I was told I could set myself up again in a program to pay it off but I ca n't continue to struggle and get no where in this loan, i need help ..."

When contacted by XXXX, I stated I was unaware of the debt, but researched it and determined I owed the amount. I agreed to pay XXXX and was told that my credit bureau would not be impacted due to the circumstances. That payment happened on XX/XX/XXXX. I have followed my credit bureau and my scores have been in the XXXX since that payment was made. My last update was on XX/XX/XXXX and my score was XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a mortgage and was told that my credit score had dropped to XXXX. This was due to a collection account being reported by XXXX XXXX The same account that I had paid in XX/XX/XXXX of the previous year. I had contacted the company and was told that the account had a zero balance and was being reported as paid in full, which it was, but was also showing as a collection account. What does n't make sense is that XXXX reported the account as a collection account XXXX months after it was paid in full and had not been reporting on my bureau during the months in between. They offered to send me a letter confirming a zero balance. I inquired as to why I was told by XXXX of their agents that this would not impact my credit when I paid it and was informed that it was their policy to report accurate data to the credit bureaus within 45 days of a debt being assigned to them for collection. I asked for a supervisor and was denied. After a second call, I asked for the trade line be removed and explained my entire situation again. I asked for a billing dispute team and was informed that they would look into pulling the original call to determine what was communicated to me. I attempted to call back a third time to lodge a formal dispute, but was unable to get through to an agent. I was forwarded directly to a voicemail at XXXX est. I made multiple attempts with the same result. I disputed the trade line with XXXX, will file a dispute with XXXX and attempt to contact XXXX again. I do n't see how this company can place a trade line on my bureau 7 months after I paid as agreed in full and was told that it would n't impact my credit.

556004,Mortgage,"Seterus offered me a no-doc loan modification in XXXX XXXX with the 3-month trial period from Oct-Dec., which I accepted. This was on a condo I own. XXXX immediately set up bank drafts for the three months. I was quite pleased that they reached out to me to help save the property from foreclosure. The property had sat vacant for several months because I could not afford the mortgage payments. In XXXX I secured a tenant in the condo and was certain of the mortgage payments. 

In XXXX Seterus sent me the agreement dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, to sign. I signed/notarized the docs on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and immediately sent them back. I was told that only my signature was needed. Upon receipt, Seterus called stating that my spouse must sign the loan modification docs. I informed them that I was since divorced and that the property was awarded to me via the divorce agreement. Seterus informed me that I would need to provide a Quit Claim Deed for the property showing that it belonged solely to me. They agreed to extend the modification for another three months, XXXX - XXXX XXXX, to give me time to obtain that Quit Claim document and immediately set up auto bank drafts for another 3-month trial period. This, Seterus confirmed, will allow them to revise the modification and send me new ones for my signature only. Seterus agreed that once the Quit Claim was received they would send a new loan modification agreement for my signature. They informed me that my ex-spouse 's name will always be on the mortgage so all I need to do was to ignore his name and sign and return the agreement. 

Sometime between XXXX XXXX I finally received the recorded Quit Claim deed and faxed it to Seterus who confirmed receipt. I never received the loan modification documents, so at the beginning of XXXX I called to inquire and to set up for automatic mortgage payments. It is from that time I started getting the runaround. They refused to take any type of payments from me, because, as I was told by numerous reps, the Quit Claim deed was received 2 days late! "" You would now have to start the modification application all over again and we would need several docs from you ''. I tried to reason with them that it was received by them within the 3-month time frame specified and that there should be no problem. 

After continuous back and forth, with each rep telling me something new each day, I spoke to "" XXXX ' ( I was told that she was a supervisor ) who informed me that she would send an email to XXXX administrators who would be able to address the issue and that she had seen this happen before where it was resolved. XXXX asked that I call her back on XXXX XXXX. When I did I was informed that she was not in and that they would have her call me back. I again inquired about continuing to make the agreed upon payments which they had been accepting since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. They refused to accept any more payments and I was informed that the property will be headed to foreclosure. I was quite confused by this turn of events. 

To date, XXXX XXXX, neither XXXX nor anyone else from Seterus have called to remedy the situation and to get me back on track in saving my property. I have made XXXX calls since then trying to set up automatic payments, but each time it was refused. As a XXXX who complied with everything Seterus requested, I believe that I have not been treated fairly. I have signed modification documents in my possession which Seterus, Inc. is now refusing to honor. 
I am now extremely stressed and though my intent is to keep the property and not ruin my credit there seems to be no other option. I am reaching out to you, and I do hope you can help. I have looked on consumer complaints websites and I was amazed to find so many complaints of the same type on Seterus, Inc. Something needs to be done!"
449254,Consumer Loan,"My ex-husband and I bought a vehicle XXXX XXXX from XXXX. Somewhere along the way it was transferred to Santander Consumer USA. He and I got a divorce XX/XX/XXXX and he was awarded the car and the debt. The last payment he made on the vehicle was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Santander at that time started harassing me about the debt and even though I told them I was no longer responsible for it and even showed them proof they still would not leave me alone. They were even calling me at work and threatening me with jail and calling acting like they were process servers. They could not get ahold of him so they just kept harassing me. They finally stopped contacting me, but then they started reporting it to the credit reporting agencies that they had repossessed the vehicle. First off, neither of us had ever received a repossession notice and Santander can not produce a notice that proves they ever sent us one. The vehicle just disappeared from the house one morning. Secondly, I have tried to contact them multiple times by certified mail and e-mail to try and come to some sort of arrangement in order to settle the matter so that I can get it removed from my credit report. I have offered to even pay part of it. They do not respond back to me. Instead, they constantly change the data on my credit report so that it stays refreshed and on my credit report. I have been battling this for 5 years now and do not know what else to do. I just want this taken off of my credit report. They are shady and underhanded and I do not think it is right that they lie and threaten you and then ruin your credit for something that is not your responsibility and then refuse to respond to you when you try to get it resolved."

465562,Student loan,"After agreeing to pay my monthly payment, the representative, XXXX, pushed me to send my private banking information to her to try to enter me into a program that she would not give me full details and information on. I refused, stating that I did not trust the company with my financial information and that I would be paying the monthly payment as scheduled. She connected me to her manager, who attempted to pressure me into giving private banking information like before. I declined and stated that I did not trust their practices and that in the past, I had been deceived and misled by their company. Therefore, I did not wish to give out any more information than was necessary to process my payment. The manager, XXXX, then began raising her voice and speaking over me about her trust in the company and defended her position, which was never in question. I told her I wanted to explain my reasoning and she yelled over me stating she did not care and would not listen. Dumbfounded, I informed her of how rude and unprofessional she was acting, and how it was not reflecting positively on her company if that is how she speaks to customers. She yelled at me one last time saying she did not care and then hung up on me. When I called back to file a formal complaint, I was told they would listen to the call and get back to me, but then proceeded to attempt to defend the managers actions and demean me. I asked for the information as to filing a formal complaint and also inquired as to if I was able to file a complaint on a separate website, and the representative became livid and rude, stating it was not her job to tell me how to file a complaint. This company has never been helpful, and has repeatedly harassed and verbally assaulted me as a customer. It is shameful and unprofessional."

I have heard this same information from multiple representatives and they have also assured me that I would be receiving my promotion in 6-8 weeks from the time I qualify for it. When I had n't received my money in the time frame mentioned above, I began to question the validity of the promotion by contacting corporate and walking into many branches. I was told the same information over and over again. I am now hearing from a XXXX XXXX in the Client Relations and Support Team that I will only be receiving {$100.00} on a smaller scale promotion. Digging deeper, I found that other complaints that I have tried to address with SunTrust Banks had gotten the lady that opened my account fired. She is no longer able to tell us what she had stated to my fiance and I when we opened the account, and SunTrust "" has no record of what was said '' even though there is surveillance in the branch inside of XXXX. SunTrust has also stated on a recorded line that many of their representatives have relayed incorrect information to me. Therefore, I would like to receive the amount of money I was promised and assured of when I opened the account, and I add that those promises were made from more than one representative. I, as the consumer, should be able to believe representatives of this financial institution when they tell me I will be getting money from a promotion, therefore I feel that I should be getting what I was promised as the consumer."

I spoke with a few reps at WU including, XXXX ( rep id XXXX ), XXXX ( a supervisor ) and XXXX ( in the XXXX Support department ), but my efforts proved futile and circular. 
Amidst the rudeness, impatience and XXXX customer service, what I could decipher from the incoherent explanations from the WU staff was that for some reason further verification was needed and that my phone number was inconsistent/incorrect/unverifiable. This is troubling on many levels : XXXX, verification was already done on XXXX/XXXX/15 when I was provided the MTCN ; XXXX, if it was n't, why was it not done and why wait 5 days until I call to report non performance on their part before they bring that up ; XXXX, I provided my phone number on XXXX/XXXX/15 and they already have it on their system as it is my main number and what I used to make the call on the said date ; XXXX, WU has already debited my account and are in possession of the funds, while refusing to honor the agreement by remitting it to the receiver ; lastly, there was no urgency exhibited by WU 's staff to right a wrong/error as chronicled here. As I was on the phone to WU, the line was "" conveniently '' cutoff a XXXX of times and I was passed from XXXX rep to another until I was jaded and moved on to do other important things like my job. 
Even after I reported this matter to WU 's corporate office on XXXX/XXXX/15, there still was no urgency to perform the service that I paid for and for which they were already delinquent. I had to gather another {$300.00} to send through a different money transmitter, while WU dilly-dallied. In the mean time because WU held on to my money illicitly, I incurred bank charges for bounced checks and the supposed receiver incurred late fees ( and immense troubles ) on his end because he was unable to pay the medical bills in a timely manner due to WU 's non performance. At the time of writing, WU is still to return my money ; they claim that they delayed my transaction for compliance reasons. If this is not an egregious breach of trust and contract, I do n't know what is. 
The purpose of sending the funds via WU has been defeated and instead they have given me more pain than gain in the transaction. Please assist in helping me obtain some accountability."

I ran another credit report on XXXX/XXXX/15 and the information is still not corrected. I have not received a refund for overpaying the same bill XXXX times. The refund should be for {$25.00} ; I realize at this point that is not a lot of many, but now it is about the principle."
262948,Mortgage,"My co-op loan was originally made with XXXX XXXX Bank, and is now held by JP Morgan Chase. 

My payment due date is the XXXX day of the month, but I have a 15 day grace period and can pay by the XXXX of the month without a late fee. Historically, if the XXXX fell on a weekend or holiday, I was allowed to pay on the following business day without penalty. 

I have recently been making payments online through the Chase website. I had a problem where I was charged a late fee for the XXXX XXXX payment. Since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was on a Saturday, I scheduled the payment for the following Monday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The bank 's mortgage department is run incompetently. They issue late fees on the XXXX even if a payment is scheduled in their system for that day. Once the payment is processed and they realize it was paid on time, the late fee is removed. 

I thought that the bank made an error and mistakenly failed to remove the late fee. I called several months ago and was told that the fee would be removed. I thought they removed it and made the same mistake again and charged me another late fee. When I called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to inquire, I spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX working in XXXX, LA. She informed me that this was the late fee from the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX payment, and it was n't removed. 

XXXX XXXX explained that the late fee was valid, saying that their payment processing center is open on Saturdays, and that if the XXXX falls on a Saturday and they have n't received payment by that date, they charge a late fee. She said that the grace period is extended only when the XXXX is on a Sunday ( and presumably bank holidays as well ), because their office is closed. 

I checked my loan agreement, and it did not mention additional grace period days when the grace period is not on a business day. But I think what Chase did was improper, for the following reasons:1 ) This was a change in policy. I do n't know if the policy was in effect when Chase took over my loan in XXXX XXXX, or if they changed it sometime after that. But I do know that for my loan, the policy changed, and I was not notified of this change. Without written notice, the policy change should not apply. I had no way of knowing about the change. 

2 ) While their payment processing center may be open on Saturdays, I 've been paying my bills on their website, and they do not accept payments on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. If permitted, I will attach or email screenshots showing that it is not possible to select a Saturday as a payment date. 

3 ) I suspect that allowing a longer grace period on days that the bank does not accept payments is done for legal reasons, not because the bank is nice. Perhaps having a processing center open to receive mail fulfills this requirement, but most people do n't pay their bills by mail anymore. For all I know, they could have a tiny office with a single employee, just to take in the mail, for the sole purpose of scamming people and charging them late fees when they do n't pay until the following Monday. 

4 ) There are no rules explaining this policy on the website. It says that payment must be received within 15 days of the due date. But on the website, I ca n't schedule a payment on either Saturday or Sunday. How am I supposed to know that if the XXXX is on a Sunday, I can pay on the XXXX, but if it is on a Saturday, I have to pay on the XXXX? There is nothing that says anything about this. Why does n't Chase allow me to schedule a payment on a Saturday if they process payments on Saturdays as they claim? The only answer is that they are running a scam to charge late fees to unsuspecting customers who think that the grace period is extended to Monday because the system does n't accept a Saturday payment. 

Please force Chase to rectify the situation for all customers. XXXX XXXX said that my late fee was waived as a courtesy, but I paid on time."

Later, that afternoon, on XX/XX/2016, I followed up with XXXX to find out the update on my request of providing me valid proof baring my signature that I authorized XXXX XXXX XXXX, to pull my credit, however, at the time of speaking to XXXX, I found out some astonishing news that was very disturbing to me, and which violated FCRA laws : 1. ) XXXX informed me that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not pull my credit report, however, she said it was a third party, who 's name she mentioned to me was Pacific One Lending in XXXX XXXX, California. I was provided with their phone number of XXXX and XXXX. I was informed by XXXX that Pacific One Lending is their client, and that they ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) offer this service to her clients for a minimal package price. I informed XXXX that I NEVER AUTHORIZED XXXX to sell my information, nor did I authorize Pacific One Lending to run my credit! I informed her that XXXX XXXX XXXX was in violation of the FCRA, and they have violated my rights. I informed her that I wanted this removed off of my credit file immediately with all credit bureaus. However, she informed me that they ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) was not allowed to remove the credit entry from the credit bureaus. I explained to her that I was not understanding her position, because it was XXXX XXXX XXXX 's name that was attached to the inquiry under my social security number, and I did not see Pacific One Lending anywhere on my credit report. I asked XXXX to provide me the document once again baring my signature authorizing either company to pull my credit, and she said she would need to contact Pacific One Lending for the authorization that she did not have it on file, because she claimed that they are not required to have it on file, because they did not pull my credit report, it was Pacific One Lending. Therefore, I explained to her once again that she and XXXX XXXX XXXX was in violation once again of the FCRA, and that both companies have violated my rights as a consumer, because their name is showing up on my credit report as a hard pull entry that I did not authorize. 
I have since contacted Pacific One Lending and spoke to one of the owners, XXXX. He said once he got into the office he would work on this complaint, however, I have yet to receive a document baring my signature that I authorized Pacific One Lending to pull my credit."

290060,Mortgage,"I am writing to express my frustration and to let you know that I intend to file a complaint with the XXXX and other regulatory agencies about the neglect and misrepresentation I received from your institution. 

I have have been a mortgage payer for almost 20 years and NEVER have been late nor have any problems paying my mortgages even in the downturn when I could have walked away from my investments like many people in the same situation in XXXX. 

I like everyone else would like the opportunity to save money and I thought that by refinancing my home that I could consolidate my debts and apply the savings towards principal reduction of my mortgage. 

Needless to say, I was SHOCKED that I was declined even with an XXXX credit score and no mortgage late what so ever. 

I went to your institution as you claim to be an industry leader, great service, and that you have excellent rates. I spoke to your loan officer and though he was thorough in the beginning, he left me hanging after he originated the loan and left me with the processor as my go-to person. 

In the interview, I asked for a 15 year and a 30 year quote and to see what the payments would be. I opted for the 15 year as I feel comfortable with the payment terms and the worse case scenario we can do a 30 year term. 

At that time he said my back end DTI as like XXXX % even with a a 15 year term. He was confident that he can get this approved so I gave him an authorization to continue. I had reservations about the cost of the appraisal even thought the LTV is only XXXX % because I am very cautious and he told me that he did n't think it will be an issue. I was explicit in my instructions that I will not pay for the appraisal until the loan is approved but he somehow he still ordered the appraisal. 

I have tried to reach out to him multiple times to see what the status of my loan. Every time I tried to call him, it will just go directly to his voice mail. I left numerous messages to call me but he never bothered and referred me to the processor. 

It was nearly 30 days before I heard from the processor stating that my DTI ( backend ) was too high. I reached out to the loan officer and gave him ammunition stating that the front end was very low and the reason the back end was too high is because I have XXXX other investment properties that I am not 100 % owner. This was fully disclosed in my loan application. One investment property was a XXXX % ownership and the other was a XXXX % ownership. I tried to explain that both investment properties were acquired in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and that both have positive cash flow and that they are in good stating and NEVER been late even both of them were slightly under water then. 

Why would the bank decline me for this? the subject property has nothing to with these investment properties. If anything, they will just make things better because I will be able to pay down my debts. if your institution will hit me for 100 % liabilities for these investments, why could n't they give me 100 % income to compensate for the liabilities. I think this is very unfair practice and is very discriminatory to single person household who 's a co-owner of investment properties. 

Had the loan officer been more responsive, we could have saved this deal. The fact that he totally ignored me and did n't want to work with me was the straw the broke the camel 's back. Because of the time delay, I lost the rate lock and now I either had to pay the extension costs or re-apply again. I decided that I will not do either. Your company dropped the ball and now I am paying for it. 

I will not be endorsing nor recommending your institution to any of my friends. I had such a horrible experience that I decided to file a complaint with the agencies which regulate your industry. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

The end result is that after a fifty-five ( 55 ) day process of drip information requests by the second loan originator by phone ( the first loan originator was at a local BoA bank branch ( 1 hour of time collecting basic loan information ), my application was forwarded to underwriter loan processor, who informed me that she would n't approve my application. 
My complaint is based on the following : 1. The time taken just to ask questions and gather loan processor requested information - 55 days 2. The lack of clear and complete information requirements communicated in documentation provided to me via post mail, in multiple loan processor discussions during the loan origination process by the loan processor 3.

The lack of clear communication along the process regarding my eligibility, or potential lack thereof 5.

After 55 days of loan processing requests and in my second conversation with mortgage loan underwriter, I was informed that the information I submitted along the process had n't been verified until the 55th day of the loan process. 
9. I had to set-up a checking account with BoA, which was completed prior to underwriter review in order to receive a loan rate discount. 

This loan process was a complete waste of my time and efforts in good faith to work with the BoA in information gathering and decision determination. The Bank should have known within 5 days of most of the information overall requested and provided whether I was qualified for this loan, and should have been able to verify any questions it had to determine my eligibility for the loan requested. 

I would like a complete review of this incident and process that was performed in order to show that the Bank was misleading in its communication and had no intention of offering me a loan at an earlier point in the loan process, but did not communicate it until nearly the end of the prolonged process and quoted time to process ( 60 days ). 

I can provide documentation as evidence that supports my complaint."

Later in the year XX/XX/XXXX i have used this card for other purchases also. So now i have XXXX type of balances a ). 0 % ARP ( balance transfer ) and b. ) Regular purchases 19.49 %. So i decided to payoff my balance of type ( b ) .My statement date is XXXX of every month. 
I paid my type ( b ) balance on XX/XX/XXXX which is two day before the statement date. So this payment did not clear any of my type ( b ) balance whereas it reduce my type ( a ) balance. 
I called Chase customer representative about this ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), i said that i was unclear about this logic how the payment applies if you pay before statement date and told them my intention was to clear the purchase balance ( type b ) .. and i have asked them if they can change the payment date to any date after statement data and provide the waiver for all the interest charges till date.and we decided chase will returne my payment and i will make the payment againt with new data. 
They refund my payment ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and i receive that payment on XX/XX/XXXX. and now i have made the payment again. 
Now Chase has charge me extra XXXX dollars as a interest because they have refund me my old payment that i made XX/XX/XXXX. 
But i dont agree with this XXXX dollars interest charge. Bank is saying this charge is for those XXXX payment that they have put back in my checking account. 
My point here is that : this payment of XXXX was sitting with chase bank from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX. Why i should pay the interest."
280648,Mortgage,"Hello -- My mortgage was bought by US Bank who have, until recently, a policy of collecting the mortgage due for a month up to 5 calendar days from the beginning of the month for which the payment is to be made ( my account details with US Bank can be made available to relevant CFPB personnel on request ). They recently changed their policy stating that even if the payment is made within the first 5 calendar days of the month for which the payment is due, they will collect an "" online payment fee '' of {$5.00} if it 's made after the XXXX calendar day of the month. I paid my XXXX 2016 payment by XXXX XXXX and they charged me this {$5.00} online payment fee. 

This was a major change, as most customers have been : 1 ) accustomed to paying within the first XXXX calendar days without incurring any fees, 2 ) was not adequately communicated to us and 3 ) when I called their customer care number they were unwilling to consider any of my points and just insisted that they had informed me by putting this somewhere on their website. I would submit that such major changes should be : 1 ) adequately communicated, specifically with emails or prominent alerts as soon as XXXX logs into one 's online mortgage account and 2 ) banks should be willing to return the amount if this has not been adequately communicated. I concede the amount is small, but after the whole mortgage servicing mess, XXXX, the banks seem to have still not learnt any lessons, and keep on nickling and diming their customers out of all sorts of fees for very little-to-no work. 

I would request the CFPB to look into the possibility of the bank refunding me this amount, on principle. and ask them, in the future, to announce such major changes prominently on their website or through their communications with their clients. 

Many thanks, XXXX."

190792,Mortgage,"I refinanced my home with XXXX XXXX. 
Green tree asked for 2 months of interest as well as 2 months of mortgage insurance to close my loan. 

They had XXXX in my escrow account at the time. 

Asking XXXX to close a loan, when you really only need XXXX ( interest ) makes it almost impossible for someone to be able to get the cash together to close on a refinance. They actually try to trap you with them as your mortgage holder. 

They also told me ( despite the proof of wire xfer ) that they had not received my money on Friday from the escrow company. 

Paying ANY mortgage insurance upfront is unnecessary as they have a balance in the account and will not be paying any future MI on my behalf. It is just a ruse to be able to float my money. 

First rep said they would refund me in 5-7 business days. Another one said 14 business days. Now it is 30 business days. No one would give it to me in writing. 

How are they able to behave this way? 

Forwarding to them will be useless - they are useless and nasty on the phone. And they lie. 
in 30 days someone will respond and say "" we are looking into your request '' in a generic, boilerplate letter, with no contact information other than the XXXX number where you get nasty people. 

Go ahead and submit to them. I have refinanced, and I will do my best to bring any legal action against them that I can. Worst loan servicer ... Ever ... Nasty, unscrupulous and they lie."

I told them I was not aware my father even had a Well 's Fargo account, but they said if someone tried to compromise it, an account probably did exist.

639028,Mortgage,"In XXXX we put down XXXX % of the value of our new home and moved in in XXXX XXXX. The closing was with XXXX, then it went to XXXX and then to XXXX XXXX XXXX. We were caught in the massive scam that banks designed to take our money and our homes. Our mortgage went from {$1400.00} to {$3000.00} from one day to the next and still we had to add every month a PMI ( Private Mortgage Insurance ) of {$390.00} so the bank was protected in case we defaulted. 
When we were straggled by the XXXX % increase in payments we called XXXX XXXX XXXX to request a refinancing of our debt as we got more and more into debt trying to pay this scam. For more than 6 months the customer service representatives of XXXX told us that since we were paying just fine there was nothing that they could do for us. After six months and at the brink of bankruptcy one rep told us that the ONLY way XXXX could help us is if we defaulted on our mortgage, stating that once that happen the refinancing department will take over ... so we did and month after month letters of default kept coming. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX filed a foreclosure on our home and we immediately responded and started to prepare for litigation. It took XXXX 5 years for move the case forward. During that time we kept paying our HOA fees and save money for the "" settlement ''. 
XXXX changed law firms 6 times during those 5 years until two months before the trial, all documents changed to Nationstar Mortgage and 10 days before the trial they made an arrangement with our lawyer to "" settle '' the case. 
All of the sudden our lawyer who was very sure of our positive outcome in trial call us and practically convinced my wife to sign the worst settlement in which Nationstar took the mortgage of the house of {$390000.00} and unilaterally added {$130000.00} in interest, fees and lawyers fees to the debt to total a {$520000.00} and then refinanced the mortgage to a 40 years period and send us back to a {$3000.00} plus {$990.00} per month to pay the most expensive hazard insurance payment in the market ( {$2500.00} when the current rate is {$1200.00} ) for the next 40 years. 
They claimed that the were complying with the HARP but the five years they unilaterally took to bring the case to court they charged it to us when that was not our fault and should have been discounted from the debt. 
We started making payments towards the "" new '' refinanced home that in the market cost {$310000.00} and for which we are paying XXXX. 
The initial three months we made the whopping {$3000.00} but in the fourth month we could only made {$2000.00}. 
Now Nationstar send us a statement saying that they are taking those {$2000.00} to pay "" fees '' instead of applying them to our mortgage. In other words the are blatantly and up front stealing our money and are now preparing to foreclose on our home. 
The Home Affordable Refinance Act has been used by these unscrupulous institutions to bend all the rules in their favor and once again make us pay a home that they received full payment from the PMI once we defaulted in XX/XX/XXXX. 
We are sick and tired of these institutions taking advantage of the working Americans and we believe that enough is enough and we need the Federal Government to step in and help us so we do n't become homeless like the millions of Americans that their homes were taking away by these greedy institutions. 
We need and demand help it can not be possible that we pay 5 years a mortgage, then they increase it by XXXX % from one day to the next, then they tell us to default to "" be able to help us '', then take 5 years to bring this to court and after all that do n't assume any responsibility for what they are doing, specially when our home was paid twice already : Once by the PMI and then by the bailout that we the taxpayers gave to these greedy banks. What else are they going to do to us while the Federal government watches?"
459342,Consumer Loan,I have already filed a complaint against JP Morgan Chase in regards to my mortgage and there lack of professional customer service. I am a victim of financial and XXXX abuse. I am in the process of getting my life in order. I was left with a huge credit debt due to my spouse. I pay my bill every month on-time. I asked if my monthly payment could be reduced temporarily until I weather the storm. I was told by them that they could not help me. I wrote letters to them explaining my situation and still they would not help me because I am current with my monthly payments. I am trying to avoid bankruptcy. I have a court order sale of my house that my spouse is in contempt of. All I am asking from them is temporary help until I am able to get on my feet. They are unresponsive and down right nasty to me. I received a positive response after filing a complaint about there customer service in regards to my mortgage and now I am asking again.
377942,Mortgage,We purchased our home in XXXX. Since then we have made our monthly mortgage payments ontime. We also have made additional payments every month and specifically asked for those payments to be put entirely towards principle.

The company has allocated the additional payments to their own desires.

460090,Credit card,"I 'm a 20+ year Bank of America credit card holder and have always been in good standing, used my account/card and made payment as agreed. 
On XX/XX/XXXX was charged {$1800.00} for an online transaction with XXXX based XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2020 the transaction was charged back in my favor, first by Claims Dept ( as if a Dispute ), then by Fraud Dept. 
My card ( ended XXXX ) was then cancelled and a number card issued ( ended XXXX ). 
On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America realized that a "" double charge back '' had taken place and the Claims Dept charged my account {$1800.00} -- therefore my card status was that a fraudulent transaction had taken place and I owned {$0.00} specific to the XX/XX/XXXX transaction. 
Then twenty days later ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), Claims Department charged my new card ( ended XXXX ) the {$1800.00} and mailed me a form letter ( received on XX/XX/XXXX ) stating that Bank of America had obtained documentation from XXXX that I had ordered and received the subject merchandise, therefore I should be obligated to pay the full {$1800.00}. 
So I contacted the merchant, XXXX, directly on XX/XX/XXXX and learned from Customer Service Representative, XXXX XXXX that she found evidence on my account that a remote operator ( supposedly working on behalf of XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX had made a "" alternate delivery request '' to XXXX changing the shipping address to XXXX XXXX, XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX a person in the XXXX network named XXXX XXXX had changed the ordering party 's e-mail address from "" XXXXXXXXXXXX '' to my e-mail address "" XXXXXXXXXXXX '' ( after I had filed a complaint about a package arriving unexpectedly at my doorstep but for which I had NOT ordered! ) I was e-mailed a copy of the XXXX XXXX History where it clearly shows that the XX/XX/XXXX item costing {$1800.00} was NOT shipped and delivered to me at my XXXX XXXX, California residence. 
To be clear, I have never done business before with this XXXX based merchant, XXXX or any subsidiaries and affiliates, they would NOT have my name/billing/credit card information on file, nor am I on their mailing list, etc. 
When I reported all of this updated information to Bank of America, they said nothing could be done by the Claims Department, that this was a matter for Fraud Department to handle. Then I called Fraud and they said this transaction was a valid dispute between two parties and that the Claims Department would have to resolve it! 
In closing, I have never before failed a complaint with the CFPB, nor had reason to complain about what has been a 33+ year relationship with Bank of America . 
In writing this -- I would like to be very clear -- Bank of America 's Credit Card Customer Service has dramatically deteriorated in recent years and can even been traced to their massive acquisition of XXXX. It now takes 20-40+ minutes to speak with live customer representatives, supervisor elevation is no longer real time, and there are unworkable "" silos '' between Credit Card departments ( Claims vs. Fraud ) leaving the consumer account holder at risk and completely unable to resolve. ( I even involved my local Bank of America branch manager and he was told the same thing -- it 's valid claim, not fraud. XXXX XXXX needs to pay his bills and do n't get involved, pass on helping him! ) I would like the CFPB to ask Bank of America to resolve this matter and also to investigate in good faith whether the involved merchant, XXXX, knowingly and willfully provided misleading information to Bank of America on or near XX/XX/XXXX claiming the subject transaction had been ordered by XXXX XXXX and physically received by him when the XXXX XXXX History and internal XXXX transaction notes proved otherwise -- even hinting at internal fraud! 
Respectfully Submitted, XXXX XXXX XXXX"
46821,Bank account or service,"I had a personal account that had a returned deposit because of fraud committed against me in 2015. I provided proof of this fraud which was also used to open accounts with other banks. Bank of America stated they removed me off of XXXX and XXXX, which was already done the year prior. I had a business account with them in good and regular standing that was recently closed after I was approved for Merchant services and upgraded my account. Which apparently triggered a hotfile attached to me. This hot file was caused by someone stealing money from another account I wrote a check transferring funds out of town. When I got back I immediately made the account positive. They removed negative reporting but placed me on a hotfile. They closed my corporate account with no notice, one that I am a signor on costing my company thousands of dollars. They will not let me withdraw my funds, they will not be accommodating in any way shape or form and they refuse to act in good faith. I want to be removed off of the hotfile. I want an apology, and I want to be assured this issue is resolved. Bank of America has blatantly not allowed me to solve this issue. They have been abusive, they have never responded to my request. I sent a packet to their internal group 4 times. They have been extremely abusive."
5852,Mortgage,"I am in desperate need of assistance I have being working with Wells Fargo. However they are refusing to settle with me, I was advised by Agent XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX from the recovery department if I find any mistake from Well Fargo they will settle with me. Therefore I submitted a letter requesting a settlement because in the Transaction statement history I was not given to proper credit towards my principle. To make matters worse in XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment to Wells Fargo for the amount of {$370.00} I was not given any credit to my principle this is clearly showing Wells Fargo was taking a bigger amount towards the interest only. I have a fix interest rate of 8.175 % and the monthly payments were for the amount of {$370.00}. The breakdown of the payments should of been how it shows in my mortgage statement which is Principal {$65.00} and Interest {$300.00}. brings a total of {$370.00}. However Wells Fargo did not give me credit for that payment and all the other payments were never broken down properly, Like I have mention I was advice trough a recorded call when I spoke with Agent XXXX if I find any mistakes they will settle with me. I do not have any additional funds to offer Wells Fargo. I was paying Wells Fargo for almost 6 years and with in those years after adding all for my history. Wells Fargo credit me {$2800.00} towards my principle and {$24000.00} towards interest. I am more than sure that Wells Fargo is practicing fraudulent and deceptive practices in order to prolong my loan. Please request a explanation from Wells Fargo. Thank you."
707568,Debt collection,"I have sent numerous debt validation notices and never received a response back from the creditor. As per the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act ( FDCPA ), a credit is supposed to response and no attempt to collect until they have responded. However, this creditor has not responded and is still attempting to collect, which is in violation of the FDCPA."
758598,Debt collection,"My husband and I entered a contract with the property management company called "" The XXXX '' ( incorporated as XXXX ) located in XXXX, WA that concluded on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Per the terms of our contract, the XXXX XXXX had 14 days after the leased property was returned to them to refund our deposit and present a statement of any charges withheld or due at that point. This can be confirmed by Section XXXX of our lease agreement ( 'Non-refundable fee and security deposit ' ) : "" An accounting and refund of the Security Deposit or invoice for additional charges, if applicable shall be made within fourteen ( 14 ) days after the Tenant has vacated the premises. '' The XXXX XXXX did provide a partial refund of our security deposit, as well as an invoice for {$100.00} withheld on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, within the dates set by the terms of our agreement. At that point, we had every reason to believe our business with them was finished. However, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX -- 24 days after the end of our lease term and when the property had been surrendered back to them -- we received an invoice for a previously unmentioned charge for 'janitorial services ' for {$220.00} that contained no other explanation. 

Knowing this charge violated the terms of our contract ( as well as Washington State Law XXXX XXXX : "" Within fourteen days after the termination of the rental agreement and vacation of the premises, ... the landlord shall give a full and specific statement of the basis for retaining any of the deposit together with the payment of any refund due the tenant under the terms and conditions of the rental agreement. "" ), we did not send an official dispute via registered mail until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, after the XXXX XXXX threatened to refer it to collections as a means of negatively impacting our credit rating for nonpayment. Since they are fully aware we have no responsibility to pay this debt, their threats denote a clear attempt at extortion. Thus we sent all our supporting documentation with our dispute notice, as well as a request that both the charges be dropped immediately and to not be contacted by the XXXX XXXX or their agents again. 

These requests were not honored though, and now we have received a collections notice dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from "" Grimm Collections '' in XXXX, WA for a {$220.00} charge that the XXXX XXXX was never legally allowed to make in the first place. The only reason we have ever been given as to why no attempt to even inform us of a need for cleaning services until 24 days after the premises was vacated was because they 'overlooked ' it. This admits to negligence on their part, that when coupled with the tardiness of their claim, negates any legal right they may have otherwise had to charge such a fee regardless of whether it was valid from the start."
214297,Credit card,"I signed up for secured credit card with initial deposit of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and had to move to new address before I receive the card. Now the CapitalOne team is asking for written address for change of address and dispatch to new address which would take atleast a month to arrive in form of utility bill etc. When I requested for cancellation of application and refund of deposit, I was told that check would be mailed to address on file ( which would be old address and no longer valid ) after XXXX billing cycles. When I requested for refund by ACH transfer, I was put on hold and disconnected after waiting for 50 minutes. When I called again, I was informed that my account has been closed and check would be mailed to old address"
211792,Consumer Loan,I had a line of credit that should not be reporting on my credit bureau. The credit line was originally with XXXX and then it was sold to XXXX XXXX in XXXX of 2014. My payments to XXXX were supposed to start XXXX of 2014 however I never received any statements from XXXX. In XXXX of the same year I receive a collections letter from LVNV Funding saying the line of credit has been sold them and is now reporting on my credit report. How can it be reporting any my credit as derogatory if I never receive statements or made late payments? I called XXXX XXXX and they have no record of this loan in my name of being sold. Due to the inaccuracies of this information I 'd like the CFPB to investigate this and ultimately have the collection removed.

I am still unclear what the {$5400.00} difference is in the amount owed and the current amount and I do n't feel I have a clear understanding where this debt came from and when the original debt supposedly went into default.

The documentation provided by PennyMac and foreclosure documents filed can not be accepted as reliable evidence of a valid transaction or a verification of debt. PennyMac must be considered unlawful and stopped from committing theft of my property and violating my rights with an illegal eviction, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

The fraudulent or unreliable evidence includes notices for a DIFFERENT PROPERTY submitted to unlawful detainer court, claim loan is a Fannie Mae loan and a Truth In Lending statement that refers to property with different address and as single family home instead of a duplex. 
Neither XXXX or PennyMac Loan Services LLC, the purported servicer for PennyMac, implemented processes ensuring their documented authority to foreclose per XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 
PennyMac failed to vacate the Truth In Lending Act rescission in effect XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and illegally sold the property on the invalid basis of a void note and could not claim perfected title.

PennyMac reported an even higher predatory rate of 12 % and a different payment for an ARM loan instead of the fixed rate of the purported loan I was assured would not have any "" toxic '' issues due to the ongoing crisis. Also included was a loan history that reflects XXXX as the investor only since XXXX. XXXX claimed to be the investor since XXXX.

The Truth In Lending statement provided by PennyMac as verification of debt not only has different terms but it does not accurately reflect the property address. Instead of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX it lists the property as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This misrepresentation raises questions as to fraud and the city actions on the property based on corrupted property data. Either this reflects a complete breakdown in the processes by XXXX, PennyMac and the city or intent to evade law by XXXX/PennyMac and/or not enforce the law to do me harm with malice. see XXXX"

290587,Bank account or service,"In XXXX, 2015, I was traveling, via my personal XXXX camper, through the remote XXXX XXXX, inside the XXXX XXXX, when I experienced loss of oil pressure that resulted in my engine seizing. My vehicle was towed to the nearest village of XXXX, XXXX, where the only garage in town told me they could replace my engine with a "" salvage yard '' engine that was in good shape. I agreed to the replacement and price. When I returned to claim my truck over a month later, the truck was running, but had numerous problems. The shop replaced the battery twice before the truck would start. Then, even though the engine was running fine, when I turned the key to the ignition "" off '', the engine continued to run. I immediately returned to the shop, and ask them why this was happening. I was told by a mechanic that my truck had "" gremlins '' in it. He told me I would have to open the hood and remove the ignition relay to get the engine to stop. Next, I saw the headlights remained on even though the key was "" off '' and the ignition relay was removed from the fuse box under the hood. The mechanic advised me I would also need to disconnect the battery each time I stopped so the various electrical connections would not drain my battery. I protested that none of these symptoms existed at any point of my 7 month, XXXX mile trip from XXXX, Texas to the XXXX XXXX, where my engine failed. Again he blamed it all on the "" gremlins '' and said they had replaced the engine, and that was what they were supposed to do. 

Though there was a blinding snow storm, and temperatures in the XXXX, I decided to set out on the long drive back to XXXX, Texas, in hopes I could at least get far enough before anything happened that I could have better options for help. Before I even got out of XXXX I noticed the engine RPMs were too high for each gear shift of the automatic transmission. Within XXXX miles of XXXX, I smelled a burning smell, and the transmission refused to engage even though the engine was running fine. In a blinding snow storm, I walked to the next small village along this desolate road, and found someone with a truck to tow me into town. One week later I was able to charter a flatbed truck passing down the road on its way to XXXX, the XXXX of XXXX XXXX. In XXXX, I found a qualified mechanic to troubleshoot the myriad problems with my truck. The mechanic used a XXXX code reader to determine all XXXX trouble codes were linked to a faulty transmission - a faulty transmission that had been replaced, along with the salvage engine in XXXX. This garage showed me the parts inside the transmission, and the seal between the engine and transmission was not new, and the gears inside the transmission were so damaged that it could not have made the more than XXXX mile journey from XXXX to the XXXX XXXX. 

Upon returning to XXXX, I contacted my bank, Wells Fargo, and disputed this payment to the garageman in XXXX. I was given a temporary credit for the roughly {$3700.00} USD. Over the next several months, the Wells Fargo Claims Center engaged in series of extremely frustrating communication, involving many form letters sent USPS to an address where I no longer live, despite my repeated requests to communicate through email. Each form letter said the same thing, and advised me to call the claims center. Each time I provided them with the documentation they requested, including a letter from the garage in XXXX that verified the work done in XXXX was not what I requested, and, while they replaced the engine as requested, they also replaced my perfectly good, recently rebuilt transmission with a faulty transmission that was attached to the rear of the salvage engine ( presumably because they could not extricate the transmission from the salvage engine ). After months, Wells Fargo ruled against me."

They always have hundreds of people pass off our file amongst each other just to create motions and delays. We intend to keep our and we meet all eligibility criteria. They have never offered any help or relief and continue to threaten to take our home. Wells Fargo Mortgage illegally commenced and is conducting a foreclosure while reviewing and attempting to find work out relief options for us. They have mishandled documents and our file several times and failed to properly communicate with us. They have clearly violated XXXX specifically under the ''dual tracking '' clause. Wells Fargo instructed and allowed the Foreclosure Trustee named XXXX XXXX XXXX to illegally start foreclosure on my property. The Wells Fargo and Know Your Options website gave the result that we are eligible for a loan modification with a lower payment to save our property.

The payment plan was told to me on the phone and then I was told for it to be valid I would be sent a copy of the payment plan to my email in a few days and would have to sign, authorize and send back to them through email. I had n't received anything in a few days so I called back and left a message saying I never received anything to my email. About a day or XXXX later I got a phone call from XXXX XXXX and he then told me he had sent it again. I checked my email and it was there this time. I never signed it printed the emailed contract and decided to take this to and attorney and see what were my rights when it came to all of this. I also pulled my credit report took that with me as well to the legal offices on post, and this card from Household bank I am allegedly owing is not on there. I then sought out and attorney through the XXXX due to the fact I am currently a XXXX at XXXX XXXX, KY. The first payment was supposed to be made XXXX XXXX according to the emailed contract they sent me but once again never signed and sent it back to them authorizing this but Offices of XXXX took it upon there selves to take that payment anyway. The attorney sent Offices of XXXX a letter, notifying them I now had representation and they were to only contact my lawyer not me directly anymore. Unfortunately they failed to do so braking the law by trying to contact me after the letter was sent also left another threatening fortuitous message, that I also saved. I am in no way opposed to paying this debit if it truly mine but I was not given any proof except XXXX XXXX stating that my social was attached to this card and it means nothing. There is so much fraud and stealing of individuals socials and identity theft I only want to be sure before I pay another persons debit, and by law I have that right. I would like for this to be investigated, my money returned and no longer harassed by this company or its processors. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you"
86860,Debt collection,"I had accounts with XXXX jewelers that were included in a bankruptcy XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX creditors filed claims and received some payment. The bankruptcy was later voluntarily dismissed. I received a call from a "" courier '' working for the "" state '' from a number with no caller ID several weeks ago. The courier needed me to be at home or work XXXX with pictured ID to serve legal documents. '' I was referenced to a phone number in NY. When I called this number I was connected to "" XXXX '' who told me my account had already been "" sent by the lawyers to my state and county '' and I needed to immediately pay the balance of the collection account XXXX bought from XXXX XXXX to cease "" legal papers. '' In a panic, I paid XXXX and made arrangements to pay the entire balance ( over XXXX XXXX in XXXX hours from my checking account. I was told I would need to sign a document forwarded to me via email to authorize this payment.

To my surprise, the collection agency XXXX XXXX ) withdrew over XXXX from my checking account without the signed consent. They money was promptly returned to the account by the agency after a fraud report was filed with our bank. 

Several days later, "" chris '' from the collection agency called my husband directly and went through the details of the XXXX account. My husband was never an authorized party on this account. It was NOT joint and XXXX had no authorization to discuss my account with anyone else. This is a violation of my privacy.

When I called National Credit Adjusters I was told that these accounts belong to them, but were "" out sourced '' XXXX.

322621,Student loan,"Mid-XXXX XXXX, I started getting strange emails and voicemails from Navient about my "" late '' payment to them. Since these were coming in about two weeks prior to when my payment was actually due XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX, and my account was up-to-date according to my records, I ignored them. After my XXXX XXXX payment was made and posted on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received another email from Navient on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating that their records indicated that they had n't received a payment from me since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and told me to call them so they could "" help '' me make my payments. I thought this was strange considering I had never missed a payment nor have I ever paid late in the six years that I 've been paying back these loans. I logged into my Navient account to investigate and immediately saw my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX payment was listed as received in my history so I called the number in the email. 

While I waited to be connected to someone, I went through my complete account history and noticed that I had been charged a late fee on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for my XXXX payment made on XXXX one day prior to the actual due date. I also noticed that they did this exact same thing to me a over year ago- in XXXX XXXX where my payment was posted by the due date- XXXX but again, I was charged a late fee two weeks later, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for that payment. Note- My loan due date is usually the XXXX or XXXX of every month so this payment was received ON TIME. 

When the customer service rep answered the line, I explained my situation : I inquired about the email I had received that morning which was a reminder that my account "" needed attention '' and I also inquired about the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & XXXX/XXXX/XXXX late fees since those were obviously mistakes since I had also paid on time in both of those months. 

After listening to my issues, the representative from Navient told me that there was nothing that she could do. According to her "" records '' my payment for XXXX XXXX was never received therefore my account was past due and that fee was valid. She had no response for the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX fee. Having the payment records open on my laptop for both Navient and my bank, I told her that that was n't true and read her the payment amounts and posted dates for all of the questioned dates. After providing documented proof of timely payments for both instances, she put me on hold and came back a few minutes later saying that she did see that my payment was received on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and did n't know why I had received the late fee. I asked her to remove both late fees received and was informed that the XXXX from XXXX was too "" old '' and therefore could not be removed ; they could only refund me the one for XXXX and apologized for the inconvenience. 

Before I got off the phone, I asked the Navient Rep if I would receive an email confirmation that shows the removal of my late fee- she did n't know- but stated that it would take a week to be refunded back to my account. I also asked her about my payment posted on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ; I wanted to make sure that this was n't going to happen again. She confirmed that my payment on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was received and stated that I SHOULD NOT receive another late fee. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received XXXX emails from Navient confirming that the late fee charged on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was removed from my account as a "" courtesy ''. The morning of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I logged into my account to verify their removal only to find that the late fees for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & XXXX/XXXX/XXXX are still there AND I also now have and additional late fee for the payment made on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX as well. I immediately called Navient, explained the situation yet again, and was told that they 'ca n't see ' any late fees on my account on their end and that my account was currently up-to-date. She could not explain to me why these fees were showing in my account history, assured me that everything is OKAY and blamed my bank, suggesting that I should sign up with their autopay program to avoid further issues."

29367,Mortgage,"I purchased the house in XXXX. Since XXXX forward I have been attempting to get some form of loan modification. I have made hundreds of calls and faxed hundreds of pieces of paper in an attempt to get a loan modification Most of the documentation that was requested by Wells Fargo, ( for the loan modification ) I had to send from one of my local Wells Fargo Branches, due to the fact that my paperwork ( regardless of the amount of attempts to fax ) was either "" never received '' or "" illegible '' or "" lost ''! Even when attempting to fax from their branch they would tell me that my fax was either "" never received '' "" illegible '' or "" lost ''! Finally in XXXX I was sent a notice that my loan payment was going down {$170.00}. I called Wells Fargo ( my loan service r ) to confirm that this was the beginning of a loan modification. After numerous calls they informed me that this was not a modification, and instead was a piggy-back loan. After many attempts to acquire the correct information, I was informed that the investors that held the load "" did not do loan modifications ''! However in the original adjustment, the payment became {$1400.00}. XXXX and after a four months the payment was adjusted again to $ XXXX. Since I receiver the original {$170.00} deduction in my loan payment until three year ago I was told it was a piggy-back loan and not a loan modification. At the point in time that the loan amount went up to $ XXXX, I requested original loan documents to be sent to my local branch. 
I returned to pick up the documents to find a complete set of papers stating I had a loan modification dating back to XXXX. Also, these documents were signed with my name!!! But I had never seen these papers before in my life!!! There are numerous examples of these same type of scenarios I have come across while dealing with Wells Fargo. From endless lies to, forgery, and consistent wrong information, Wells Fargo has been IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK WITH!! 
Forward to today, I recently was denied for a loan modification again. This time for two reasons : 1.Because of the investors. 
2. Because I "" do n't make enough money '' and Wells Fargo will not inform me about how much I have to make! 
On XXXX XXXX XXXX I received a letter stating that I had Loan Preservation Specialist. ( XXXX XXXX ) It also stated that XXXX XXXX { My Loan Preservation Specialist ) stated that she would work with me on the loan modification process.

At that time they informed me that I did n't have send in my change of circumstance eight days before my sale date, I had to send it in XXXX days before my sale date. Please note that the date of manufacture of the letters sent to me from my "" Loan Preservation Specialist '' were XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX. Both of which were past the XXXX day lead time necessary for the change of circumstance documents to be submitted! To conclude ....

It 's worthy to note that the consistent increase was not due to any new information I provided after the initial set of information they received, but after a long period of radio silence, when I was not getting responses to my emails or phone calls and messages, they told me that cash to close was increased because they had just noticed my Home Owner 's Association fee of {$120.00}! And for that they could n't close my loan unless I came in with $ XXXX in cash! Mind you, they had all this information from XXXX XXXX, but just realized it in XXXX XXXX, after they changed their interest rate and cash to close amount 3 other times, consistently going higher every time until it reached an amount that I had no choice but to drop the refinance. 
I was dodged around among XXXX people for the 4 months and each one of them gave me a different reason for their unjustified very very late decision. 

They wo n't even refund my appraisal fee so I can go pursue another refinance since I still need to change my mortgage from an interest only ARM to a 30 year fixed. 

I am totally shocked with the lack of professionalism and ethics of this financial company and the fact that they are out for your money at any cost. I will never do business with them! Hope you wo n't either!"

They never validated debt to me and are in violation of FDCPA and continue to report on the debt.

137878,Payday loan,"I currently have XXXX {$300.00} payday loans from XXXX different storefronts in my neighborhood : XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and Advance America. I also borrowed an installment loan in the amount of {$2600.00} from XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I am drowning in debt and I ca n't handle it anymore. I need some relief. This is very stressful and expensive. 

I first started using payday loans about 6 or 7 years ago. My current situation of using multiple payday loans every two weeks started at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. My roommate moved out and I had to figure out how to cover all of my housing expenses on my own. At this point, I 've been churning XXXX payday loans every two weeks for over two years, and I 've paid an estimated {$10000.00} in fees, at least. To make matters worse, I 've been paying {$140.00} every two weeks on a XXXX XXXX installment loan, and I 've already paid {$2200.00} between XXXX of last year and XXXX of this year. But my total balance as of XXXX XXXX is still {$2600.00}! How is this even possible? 

On top of my outstanding payday and installment loans, I have a car note from my credit union that I pay {$320.00} a month on, plus {$180.00} in insurance. Plus, my rent is {$1100.00} every month. After taxes, I only bring home about {$1800.00} a month. So this is really hurting me and I 've reached my breaking point. I 'm really struggling to figure out a way to get out of all this expensive, cyclical debt. I do n't want to default on the loans, but at this point I 'm not seeing another alternative. I recently received XXXX utility disconnection notices from my gas, water and light companies. To make matters worse, I 'm also facing being laid off from work in the next few months. 

I need help. I do not have the ability to repay all these loans. I recently found out that it 's against the law for lenders to extend multiple loans to a borrower with an outstanding loan. So legally I should n't have even been able to get XXXX payday loans plus an installment loan at once. Can the CFPB help me in any way?"

The mortgage servicer did not properly credit my account on a number of occasions XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX and statements mailed out had errors in them. I contacted Seterus multiple times via phone requesting the corrections to be made and a corrected statement be sent indicating the corrections to ensure proper crediting of my account. As I had not received the corrected statements or any response to my request in months, I followed up with a written request sent via fax on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and subsequently again on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I received a generic letter from Seterus on XXXX XXXX, 2015 confirming the receipt of my inquiry. However, as of today i have not received a satisfactory response and believe the servicer owes me money for the incorrectly processed payments. 
On a separate note, this company has no established procedures for handling client inquiries. When i contacted them via phone in early XXXX to follow up on my fax as of XXXX XXXX, I was told that the correspondence is being handled by a different department and the agents were not able to assist me. Instead they gave me a different fax number. However, I indicated to the agent that the only fax for their company that is known to me is listed on the statement and nowhere on the statement or any mail ever received from Seterus is there a note stating that for correspondence a fax should be sent be to a different fax number. Even the website does not provide any other fax number. How is a client supposed to know if the company does not print accurate contact information on their correspondence with the client. When i brought it up to the attention of the manager on XXXX XXXX, 2015 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, she shrugged it off and said it was not her problem. 
In summary, Seterus Inc should be investigated for the lack of transparency in handling customer inquiries and accountability for their errors. It appears there are no established process in place to handle basic operations such as customer inquiries and no quality control processes to prevent errors in payment processing. 
Unable to resolve my issues and faced with extremely poor customer service for the past 5 years i decided to transfer my loan to another company. Seterus Inc should not be in business."

This account was on autopay from our checking account so the bank took the extra money rather than us sending it. Although the check we received was dated XX/XX/2017 the envelope we received it in was post marked XX/XX/2017. This means that not only did the bank overcharge us {$640.00} they also held our money for no good reason for at least two weeks without payment of any interest. This is an unacceptable abuse of a customer.

592580,Mortgage,"Ten years ago, I set up a HELOC loan as a XXXX mortgage on my home, in order to take care of emergency bills that had arisen, etc, and then with other needs over time, that amount ended up at $XXXX, which I have now been paying Interest-Only on for the past XXXX years - around $XXXX/month.  Originally, back in XX/XX/XXXX, I was going to pay off all of my debt (including the HELOC and primary mortgage) with the sale of land, for which I had committed buyers for $XXXX total, for XXXX land parcels totaling XXXX acres.  However, an administrator for XXXX County messed up my subdivision transaction, dragging me out for 2 years, and costing me XXXX of dollars.  I lost both buyers at around the 1 year mark, and then by the XXXX year mark when the County finally gave me the subdivision, the real estate market crashed.  At that point, my house was completely upside-down on just the 1st mortgage, let alone the HELOC sitting as the 2nd.  Zions Bank is the lender for the HELOC.  I didn't feel the financial pain of being upside-down until my ex-wife abandoned our marriage for another man, XXXX, and then drained me of XXXX of XXXX of dollars.  At that point, I was trying to live on a monthly deficit, so I tried to work with Zions Bank to allow a short sale --which my primary mortgage lender, XXXX, was willing to do.  But Zions refused.  They also refused to work with me on any principal reduction or modification.  Fortunately, my primary lender provided a modification program significant enough to keep me in the home, so I kept paying the approx. $XXXX/mo to Zions and didn't skip a beat.  Then, in XX/XX/XXXX, my corporate employment ended, due to our company being bought and downsized.  By the time my severance pay ended in XX/XX/XXXX, I hadn't been able to obtain a job that came anywhere near replacing my income, so I was in a more serious monthly deficit than ever before.  So, I contacted Zions Bank again to discuss the situation with them and see what they would work out with me.  They told me to fill out a Hardship Packet, so I spent hours gathering all the information, filling out the forms, etc, and submitted it.  They responded back with a denial letter, stating that my income was TOO LOW to qualify for their loan modification program!!  I was blown away -- that was the whole reason I had submitted the hardship packet in the first place.  Why would I have even approached them if my income was sufficient??!!  SO, I complained about the denial, and they said I could submit an appeal.  Which I did right away; and all they did was deny it too, on the same basis.  It was a sham.  Fast forward to this summer, when I received a letter from Zions Bank, stating that my HELOC will balloon to a payment of approximately $XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX (a little over XXXX weeks from now).  The letter said to contact them if I ""anticipate difficulty in being able to make the required payments"" and said, ""there may be options available to you""...and then they listed various options, such as ""extension of loan term"", ""interest rate reduction"", ""principal forbearance"", etc.  But, when I contacted them, they informed me that -- since I had already been denied by them previously -- they wouldn't do anything to help me, unless I could show that my income had significantly improved!  Again, if my income had significantly improved, why would I be contacting them?!?  So, I am sick and tired of their tactics -- they are essentially forcing me to default, so they can put me into collections.  That is going to harm the credit standing I have worked XXXX years to maintain, and I am extremely frustrated with them.  A friend of mine heard about my situation and suggested I contact CFPB."

'' ISSUE # 2 when I got my account ledger after I paid off the vehicle I noticed that there were some mechanic fees included in the beginning of my loan, more than {$400.00}, I requested my account rep to provide me with an invoice or supporting documentation to what was done on the car that I had to pay for ( since I never serviced the vehicle when I got it and never took out a loan to service it either ) the only response I got was "" the car dealership i purchased my vehicle from told them to include this amount in the account, with no invoice or nothing to show what was paid for and since the dealership went out of business there 's no way in obtaining any information ... but I do have to pay it or they wont release my title and send the repo & account to collection '' ISSUE # 3 at the end of my loan term I was completely current with all my payment, paying the normal amount every month. One day I received a phone call from the security desk at my JOB, they told me someone is here to see you, when I went down to my surprise it was a repo wanting to take my car. I explained to the guy that I was current on my loan and they sent him in mistake. After contacting my account rep she told me that CFS wanted the entire sum of my payments all at once and will not accept monthly payment anymore. I owed about {$1400.00} left on the car and they wanted it all that day. As there was no negotiation accepted I went to the company to pay the full amount all at once. Once I got there and gave them the cash, CFS told me there is still missing about $ XXXX- {$400.00}. I asked what for and to my surprise they included the repo fees on my account since they had to send the guy to get my car. as I explained that they sent him in accident, that I was not late in my payments, the rep was not willing to work out anything and told me to pay the repo fees or we will continue to send the repo until we obtain your car or the full payment amount. So i had no choice but to pay up the repo fees as well."

394133,Bank account or service,"Suntrust Bank has continuously reorganized transactions that are on my account to ensure that they are able to get multiple ovedraft fees for transactions. They have even left CASH DEPOSITS pending and not posting to my accounts causing fees to happen. They will take transactions that have been pending for days ( with smaller balances ) and reorder them and process a newer larger pending transactions so that all the funds that are allocated and supposedly already being held for current pending transactions are used. So now there is an OD fee so when the funds that are held on pending transactions are freed, they are eaten up by the OD fee causing the ALREADY pending transactions that are ( Previously authorized for payment with funds taken from available balance ) to not be able to be paid and Overdraft. I was charged a {$36.00} OD fee for a {$94.00} charge because I only had {$94.00} available at the time. I was charged {$36.00} for a {$0.00} differential. This has happened before on my account. There was a {$20.00} cash deposit pending when this happened as well. So why was my deposit of CASH not processed? If my {$20.00} CASH deposit was processed I would have been able to cover the {$.00} as well as the subsequent {$15.00} Gas charge that I also received a {$36.00} OD fee for because it was not money there. Well I apologize the {$20.00} CASH deposit was and is still pending. So now my account is overdrawn {$69.00} which is {$72.00} ( XXXX OD fees ) +XXXX+XXXX+XXXX= XXXX - ( {$20.00} Cash Pending ). I have checked and honestly due to Overdraft fees for reorganizing drafts and transactions and holding deposits ( CASH DEPOSITS ) I have paid in excess of {$1000.00} in Overdraft fees to date. I have already paid these fees to keep from having to pay the extended fee but I truly feel like paying {$36.00} for {$0.00} makes me feel like I have been XXXX by the bank and no one cares. Why could this not be a courtesy reversal. I called and had absolutely no complaint about the {$15.00} charge and Overdraft fee. I know how unethical and unconcerned this bank is for it 's customer 's welfare. They are more concerned with the dollar amount. I would like to be refunded my {$36.00} for that {$0.00} differential as that is extremely excessive abuse of the OD fee penalty. This has happened previously with a OD fee for a charge less than {$.00} and they gave a credit so I am no longer eligible for any future credit according to XXXX the Rep and the branch.

When I called to inquire about this, ACS told me they had made a mistake on my loan payment in 2011 and had to make an adjustment this year. I asked when this adjustment occurred, since I could not see it on my payment record. They told me the adjustment was applied 'behind the scenes ' and would not show on my payment records screen. This leads to my specific concerns : 1. I do not see how an adjustment for a mistake on their end becomes taxable income on my part ( I was in school at the time these funds should have been applied and would not have had to pay tax on them ). 

2. The corrections are too opaque. If there is no evidence of an adjustment, how to I know it occurred. 

3. This reported income has changed the amount of interest they are claiming I paid on my loans this year. According to my online payment records on the ACS website, I have paid {$1600.00} in total on my loans this year, with {$630.00} being applied to interest.

In the paperwork, it did n't state whether through the modification my rate would be adjustable or fixed. My mortgage had been adjustable. I told my attorney that I would not sign a modification that was still adjustable just for my payments to balloon and get in trouble again. My attorney 's office spoke to XXXX ( they had third party authorization and XXXX would not speak to me ) and assured me that XXXX told them it would be fixed. So, I signed for the trial hamp. In the process of finalizing the trial, I had issues with my lawyer 's office taking care of what I requested. In fact, right before signing the trial hamp, my lawyer 's rep told me that I should speak to XXXX myself about questions I had. Because of this, I wanted to fire them. I lost faith in them and tried to speak to XXXX 's office again and they said I had to send them a letter stating my lawyer no longer represented me which I did. After doing so, I was nervous about the final modification and needing another lawyer to finish. I spoke to XXXX 's manager who assured me a lawyer was n't necessary. He said he handled about XXXX modifcations and only about XXXX had lawyers. So, I did not seek another attorney. When the final modification paperwork was on it 's way in the mail, XXXX called me to tell me that I would get a copy for myself and a notary would come to my house to have my wife and I sign it. When I got my copy and before signing, I noticed that it did n't state it was a fixed interest rate loan. I called Wells Fargo to speak to XXXX before the notary arrived. XXXX was n't available at the time but another home preservation specialist asked if they could help. I said I was assured by my lawyer that she spoke to XXXX and the rate would be fixed for the remaining payments. I wo n't sign if it is n't fixed. He said he would check and had me on hold for about 10 minutes. When he came back on he said he spoke to his supervisor and they can assure me it will be fixed. So I signed with the notary and assumed all would be fine. Then I got a letter a couple months ago saying my interest rate would be changing XX/XX/XXXX. I called Wells Fargo and spent over an hour over a couple days being transferred around. Finally, they said they said they see records on their end of telling me my loan would be fixed but sorry, that is n't the case. They opened up an investigation and after weeks, someone from Wells Fargo called me to tell me, yes they told me that it would be fixed but it is not. That is not what I signed.

681982,Mortgage,"We purchased our home XXXX XXXX with a reverse mortgage originated by XXXX XXXX and transferred to Reverse mortgage Solutions ( RMS ). On XXXX XXXX, XXXX we received a notice from RMS that we owed {$1100.00} for delinquent taxes and insurance. I called customer service for an explanation and was told {$790.00} was for insurance they paid due to a lapse of coverage of my homeowners insurance and {$390.00} was for unpaid property taxes.Regarding the insurance charge : We have a Homeowners Association that covers the property and the policy at time of closing was a 3 year policy that did not terminate until XX/XX/XXXX. I referred her to my HOA and they faxed a copy of the policy to RMS. I was forced to do this on 3 separate occasions over a 2 year period and each time I was reassured by an RMS representative that it "" would be taken care of ''. It never was. 
Regarding the claim for unpaid taxes : During the same 2 year period when I attempted to solve the insurance issue I asked for the date the supposed tax payment was not made and was told "" sometime during the tax year of XXXX. I have cancelled checks verifying all taxes paid om time from XXXX thru XXXX, therefore there could not have been a "" missing '' tax payment for that period. 
After each of these sessions with an RMS rep I would receive a monthly statement showing no delinquent charges which led me to believe that finally we had cured the issues. Not so. 
XXXX XXXX we were placed in foreclosure by RMS. Realizing working with a customer service rep was not accomplishing any results I contacted the department head and was told he would start and investigation. As a result of their investigation, RMS agreed the {$790.00} insurance charge was not valid and credited the charge to my loan balance. His research into the tax issue discovered that the mortgage originator, XXXX XXXX when preparing the closing documents included XXXX, XXXX and XXXX quarter taxes but did not compensate for the XXXX quarter taxes. 
Not sure why with all of my dealings with RMS.s reps over a 2 year period no one was able to provide me with this information, however after being provided with the proper accounting breakdown I realized how the mistake occurred and the claim was legitimate. I forwarded a cashiers check and assumed that the 2 year ordeal of stress and frustration was finally over ... not so. Two days after RMS received my cashiers check, they filed a "" notice of default '' against our property!! 
Initially, I felt we were just dealing with an inept dysfunctional organization, however it appears this is a deliberate company strategy to rip-off innocent people and acquire their property. My wife and I are both honest responsible people in our XXXX 's with in excess of {$100000.00} in equity in our home. At no time during this process we were not willing or unable to pay the disputed amounts, however we knew without a doubt the insurance charge was not valid so why were we to accept the claim for the taxes when we were never provided any type of accounting that this was owed by us. Furthermore, we received monthly statements from RMS and these items never once appeared anywhere on the breakdown even though there were specific line items addressing both of these items, they also showed XXXX balance owed. For us having to deal with the constant intimidation and coercion from this company may not be illegal but is unquestionably unconscionable and they need to be stopped somehow from their deceitful practices."

After I listed all of our bills to them, they determined that we were not eligible for lowered payments. When I asked why, I was told that since we put {$300.00} into a savings account every month, we could afford to pay the almost {$500.00} Navient payment. I do not agree with that because any good accountant knows that everyone needs a savings account. I made it clear that we were willing to pay, just not {$500.00}. They said there was nothing they could do for us but to put us on forebearance, which includes {$150.00} payment every 3 months it gets renewed. How does Navient expect people to live if they expect all of their extra money to go to them?

265559,Mortgage,"I have a mortgage which I originally obtained in XXXX through the VA. I paid the mortgage through XXXX. It was taken over by XXXX XXXX XXXX. The transition was smooth. Last year my mortgage was sold to Carrington. This transition has been the worst I have ever had to endure not to mention demeaning and discriminatory. In the beginning Carrington sent me information about the transition. They sent me a bill with an increased mortgage payment of around {$60.00} or more. When I called them I was told they required three months of escrow in the escrow account and I had a choice to pay them upfront or monthly. Then they stopped sending me statements with the payment coupon. Originally I thought maybe the mail person had delivered it to the wrong address. I sent them a check to an address from a previous letter from them. After another month of not receiving a statement I called them, a phone call I hate to make because they are the rudest company I have ever encountered and the call ends in my anger and yelling. I called the company on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I spoke to XXXX different people without any closure to this problem. The supervisor informed me that Carrington will not be sending me any statements because I have a bankruptcy filing. I informed her that the bankruptcy was filed XXXX yeas ago in XXXX and was discharged in XXXX and therefore should have no bearings now. She said that by law if a customer has ever filed bankruptcy they will more than likely do it again, so their accounts are flagged and Carrington does not send these customer any communications. So I asked her how I was supposed to pay my bill. I was again given choices- look on the website to see what I owe and mail it to an address I have on hand, pay by phone, or send them a letter requesting bills to be mailed to me. My bill was due on the first of the month. I told her I was trying to figure out what had happened to the bills and since it was n't paid by the first they were now going to charge me more interest for the extra days during the grace period and late fees if I had n't figured it out before the XXXX of the month. She said that was untrue, paying after the first does not incur more interest and no late fees are charged. I believe this is false information. I also believe a discriminatory practice is being practiced by this company in addition to priming a customer for fees by not sending them statements. I should not have to mail a request to receive statements. I asked her to send me a letter telling me about this law of no communication if you have ever filed a bankruptcy during your lifetime. She said she ca n't. I asked her to mail me an envelope with the address that I was to send this request to so that I would be sure it was reaching the correct place. She said they ca n't send me anything because of my bankruptcy even if it was 17 years ago. So each month they expect me to call or go on the website to see how much I should pay and if they have increased my mortgage for some other fee they want to charge me."

If I want to be considered for new payment plan, I have to start the process over. I have been waiting for approximately 4 months for an answer to my request. No one contacted me about my initial request and the fact that it has been ignored. Additionally, the information I have received from FedLoan has been misleading and untruthful.

427863,Bank account or service,"Hi, TD BANK FALSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND BANKING TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO PROFIT WHICH IS AGAINST THE LAW UNDER THE FCC LAWS. TD BANK CHARGED ME {$150.00} NSF FEES FOR A MISLEADING BANKING TRASACTION THAT TD BANK SAYS WAS {$250.00}, BUT THE TRANSACTION WAS ACTUALLY {$140.00}, THEREFORE TD BANK LIED IN ORDER TO PROFIT AND THEY MANIPULATED THEIR BANKING SYSTEM IN ORDER TO PROFIT BIG MONEY FROM LOW INCOME FOLKS LIKE ME FOR THE PAST YEAR. NOT ONLY DID THEY MANIPULATE THEIR BANKING SYSTEM BUT THEY ALSO COMINGLED THEIR FUNDS REPEATEDLY WITH MY ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO PROFIT. I HAVE REPEATEDLY REQUESTED FROM TD BANK TO SPEAK TO THEIR CEO, AND TD BANK DENIED ME THIS REQUEST. 
******TD BANK NEVER RESPONDED TO ME OR RESOLVED MY LAST COMPLAINT WITH CFPB AGAINST TD BANK. ******* TD BANK SHOULD BE SUED IN COURT AND FINED AGRESSIVELY FOR A COMPLETE REFUND TO ME FOR FRAUDENTLY COMINGLING FUNDS AND MANIPULATING THE BANKING SYSTEM. 
TD BANK FRAUDENTLY overdrew my account and broke the law under the Fair Debtors and Creditors act and the Privacy Act. First, They purposely held pending transactions that the merchant had already sent through. Meaning they held pending transactions so that my account would incur NSF fees totaling {$150.00} which far exceed the amount of the total of my transactions which totaled {$30.00}. They also switched the amount owed from {$250.00} to {$150.00} to trick me, the account holder, into believing that I owe more to TD BANK when in fact I owed less. This is excessive behavior and abuse of power. I filled out paperwork for them to not approve any overdraft fee payments. TD BANK CONTINUED TO PAY THEM EVEN THOUGH I INFORMED THEM AND FILLED OUT PAPERWORK THAT I DO NOT WANT TO PAY IT. TD BANK LIED AND INFORMED ME THAT I FILLED OUT THE WRONG PAPER WORK, BUT THEY WERE THE ONES THAT GAVE ME THE PAPERWORK TO BEGIN WITH, SO THEY KNOWLINGLY GAVE ME THE WRONG PAPERWORK TO FILL OUT SO THAT I COULD INCUR MORE FEES WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF CFPB LAWS. They are trying to penalize me and charge me for overdraft protection that I never requested to begin with AND filled out an application stating that I DO NOT WANT THEM TO PAY IT. They are lying and severely breaking the law. They are just trying to profit from the consumers with the lowest monies in their accounts to utilize - that money that they generate from NSF fees - to pay out to their customers with big business and big money. What they 're doing is fraud and illegal. They 're commingling funds and manipulating their currency to accumulate a substantial amount of money through NSF fees TO PROFIT. A reasonable person under the same and similar circumstances would agree with me. You should also contact their Executive department / CEO because their regulation department will not inform their executive office of their wrongdoing because they know that they would be fired if their Executive department / CEO found out this information of their wrongdoing. I 'd like a refund of all of my NSF fees totaling {$250.00} due to their fraudulent activity and their disobedience of the law under the Federal Trade Commission. THESE EVENTS TOOK PLACE FROM XXXX XXXX, 2016 TO XXXX XXXX, 2016. 
Also, When you call their customer services reps, their reps do n't even understand their manipulative banking computer system because if you check each recorded phone call conversation that I MADE TO TD BANK, I HAD TO ASK FOR A SUPERVISOR BECAUSE THE BANKING CUSTOMER SERVICE REP WOULD SAY THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY ACCOUNT."

I tried calling numerous times trying to tell people that I just wanted to talk to someone about my options but no one would return my phone calls.

( 7 ) A month later I was sent what they called an appraisal. ( It has now been at least six months later ) It was not an appraisal - it was an exterior BPO and done by a realtor and not a certified appraiser. I have a real estate license and I know that according to FIRREA rules that we can not do appraisals for mortgage loans as this is illegal. It also states that if lenders wish to ensure payment for appraisals they must request payment before. ( Strangely I was studying the new laws of the CFPB for my continuing education in real estate in XXXX. ) ( XXXX ) As I have found out that getting help with mortgages from the government is a big farce I feel I should not have to pay for an appraisal which I was told was a mistake, and which it says right on it that it is NOT an appraisal, and I certainly did not receive it promptly.

I have worked very hard on my Credit Report and it has decreased by XXXX points due to this matter, which I feel is due to their mistake. 

Thank you very much"
770508,Credit card,"I want to thank you in advance for your assistance. I am so fed up with Capitol One it 's not even funny. I have been working on my credit for over a year to raise my score in order to be able to qualify for a home purchase. A few months ago I established a Capitol One Bank credit card so that I could establish more credit. Everything was fine and good until I never received a bill from them. 

Because I never received a bill from them I attempted to call them. I attempted to call them with both numbers on the back of the card. Every time I tried calling them, I would never get to a representative, i would get hung up on, or sometimes I would be transferred to some XXXX representative. Well today after still not receiving a bill and not being able to contact them I tried one more time. I was not satisfied at all with the entire process. Capitol One is reporting me 30 days late. When I called today I decided to record the call so that I had proof of the craziness and arduous process one has to go trough to get to capitol one. 

When I called the number on the back of the card, I could not get to a representative. I had to repeat myself multiple times for the machine to recognize my request. Even after I was FINALLY able to speak to a representative, I almost hung up because after they answered, no one was on the line for nearly 20 seconds. I had to say Hello many many times before the representative XXXX finally answered. Once he answered things did n't get better ... 

When I spoke to him he admitted that he did n't have my address but he also would n't tell me what address he had on file for me. He said it was a security precaution even though the system verified me before speaking to him ... When I told him my problem he did n't care and said he could n't correct the late payment reporting because not getting a bill and not being able to contact them was not a reason to fix it ... That is a lie. I own a XXXX myself and I know that I ca n't simply send someone to collections or place an account in delinquent status if I do n't bill them first. Instead of helping me he decided to transfer me to a supervisor. 

The supervisor was no better. I will attempt to shorten this as I am running out of space but essentially she agreed that they did n't have my address at first but now they do. She said she would submit a dispute on my behalf to the bureaus.. I told her why would she do that when I could do it myself. What I wanted to know is if Capitol One would remove the late payments as they have n't billed me and I am unable to get in contact with them. She said she could not remove the late payments because they did n't control credit reporting but the credit bureaus did. I know that is a lie and I told her I knew it was as credit bureaus do not control reporting rather they are keepers of information. She then said that they do n't simply push a button in order to report or not report. I told her I knew that was a lie too as companies send their reporting to the bureaus electronically. She still would n't agree to remove anything even though they know I never got a bill since they did n't have my address. Even after attempting to pay them they still were giving me trouble! They could n't accept my debit card for unknown reasons! If I did n't have my checkbook I still would n't be able to pay them and would probably have more late payments reporting. 

In other words, I 've never received a bill, I ca n't reach them until today, even when I do reach them, it takes 30 seconds to respond which almost causes me to hang up. They do n't have my address, they blatantly lie to me about credit reporting procedures, they ca n't even accept my legitimate XXXX debit card for payment! How is this fair or a legitimate business practice? If they ca n't remove these late payments that stem due to no fault of my own, my credit will be ruined. Help me!"

614031,Bank account or service,"In XXXX XXXX, I went online and cancelled the {$25.00} automatic monthly scheduled transfer from my BOA checking to savings account, but the bank made a mistake and started the transfer back up on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, without my authorization, charged me a {$35.00} overdraft fee because I did n't have {$25.00} to transfer in the first place, and left me with a negative - {$60.00} balance in my checking account. What kind of program do they have anyway that allows somebody to transfer negative checking account funds to a savings account to incur an overdraft fee on the checking account??? When I called today to complain about the transfer and fee, I asked when I supposedly reauthorized a transfer ( which I did n't ) and they could n't tell me the date, but said I was sent a low balance alert, which means nothing because I knew the balance was low anyway and I do n't have to maintain a minimum balance to avoid the monthly maintenance fee. Please make them put the {$35.00} they took from me back in my account because what they did was wrong. I am a XXXX on a very tight budget and it 's not fair that they are taking my money like this. I had to get a loan from my mom to cover the overdrawn checking account balance until this is resolved. You have my permission talk to her about this."

An email was sent to me on XX/XX/2016 and that is the only communication I have had with them in writing. They have filed this collection on my credit report. This has had a negative impact on my credit score that I have worked so hard to build and I believe they should rectify the situation and take this off of my credit report. When we spoke on the phone, I was told that the originator creditor did not have my current address and instead of trying to receive it, they turned me into collections. This was very unnecessary considering I had my child at the XXXX hospital and ever though the creditor and hospital are XXXX separate entities, they could have exercised due diligence and found my current information without messing up my credit."

753948,Bank account or service,"My checking account was garnished by a third party for a judgment debt. The bank charged my account {$110.00}, then charged me {$74.00} more because it paid off XXXX of my charges that did not go through for the very reason that the bank had frozen MY funds and then also assessed that garnishment charge ( which I never was made aware of or agreed to at any time ). Pursuant to Minnesota garnishment law I mailed the bank my signed notice of exemption form proving that all of the funds in the account came from sources ( social security and pensions ) exempt by state and federal law from garnishment, along with 60 days of bank statements. More than six business days have expired. The judgment creditor did not send or serve any objection to my notice of exemption to me or the bank.

I complained in person to my local branch office. The person there told me that the bank had already paid my exempt funds to the garnisher, and I would have to get my money from them!! The bank has completely ignored its statutory and fiduciary duties to me by ripping my exempt money from my account and giving it to a creditor, and added insult by charging me almost {$200.00} for the favor of their victimization.

624412,Mortgage,"Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC failed to respond completely to a QWR composed XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Ocwen did notify me that an extension would be needed to adequately respond to requests for production & answer questions. However, their Research Department sent the final/ incomplete response prior to the extension deadline of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
A follow-up to the initial QWR ( QWR # 2 ) was sent from me to Ocwen on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX explaining that their response was unsatisfactory/incomplete and that it was my hope that a complete Response would be sent to me by the deadline of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This did not happen. Instead, Ocwen has sent duplicate packets of incomplete information hoping that they will suffice. 
In an effort to avoid sending an extremely long & complicated QWR that may be construed by Ocwen as being overbroad, I have sent XXXX additional QWRs to Ocwen ( # 3 and # 4 ) XXXX dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. QWR # 3 was composed to reply to Ocwen 's Response letter & ask additional Servicer-related questions. QWR # 4 was composed to record an inventory of the information that has been sent by Ocwen thus far & to explain which requests for production & answers remain outstanding. 
My mortgage was never registered with MERS ; so, all transfers of title should be recorded with XXXX XXXX, Colorado. According to the information made available to me by Ocwen, documents produced by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX formerly XXXX XXXX, & documents recorded with XXXX XXXX, Colorado, there had been no transfers of title since the inception of my mortgage with XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) until, coincidentally, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Since XXXX XXXX filed for Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX would think that at least XXXX transfer of title would need to have taken place prior to, on, or about that date, but that is not the case. Using this publicly recorded data, it is my claim that Ocwen has, as a knee-jerk reaction to my inquiries, fabricated a "" XXXX XXXX of Deed of Trust ''. Additionally, Ocwen has filed this fabrication with XXXX XXXX, Colorado as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In short, it seems as if my mortgage loan has not been funded since XXXX XXXX, XXXX. A XXXX/XXXX/XXXX HAMP modification agreement names no investor or lender ( only HomEq as the Servicer ). 
Per my original mortgage contract, I am obligated to defend generally the title to the property against all claims and demands. I believe the "" Assignment '' filed by Ocwen maliciously slanders my title ; thus, after speaking with the Recorder 's office was given permission to file a Notice of Defective Title with XXXX XXXX, Colorado. 
Per discovery thus far, I do not believe Ocwen, as purported Attorney-in-Fact for XXXX XXXX, has standing to be considered a party to my mortgage contract. However, I will abide by my contractual agreement by not initiating or joining any judicial action regarding a breach of any provision of the security instruments by the other party until I have served Ocwen with a formal Grievance and allowed Ocwen the lawful time period in which to respond. 
As an aside to the title matter, after having had time to compare & contrast documentation regarding my mortgage loan transaction from Ocwen and XXXX XXXX, there are blatant Truth in Lending violations that do not necessitate forensics to understand. As XXXX dive deeper into this investigative process, in retrospect, it is clear to see that I was a victim of predatory loan practices, appraisal fraud, & put on a dual-track modification path. I will be outlining all of these items in more detail in a formal Grievance after I receive Ocwen 's Response to my latest QWRs. I will update the CFPB accordingly.

The PayPal representatives suggested we send the money directly to the person 's email, but the rate remained the same. Their other suggestion was to adjust the amount to the USD amount, but that would 've meant the seller would lose {$530.00} on the sale. 

This is not fair to buyer or seller. PayPal should have updated rates, but a XXXX search revealed their currency exchange rates are often six ( 6 ) months out of date. That should be illegal. 

In the end, there was nothing to be done but to pay the inflated PayPal rate, as we needed to pay the seller for the services required."

156927,Mortgage,"This regards a 30 year fixed primary mortgage currently being serviced by Wells Fargo. This morning while talking with a bank representative, it came to my attention that the default way excess payments on my account are processed is not as most consumers including myself would assume. Apparently, paying extra and not specifying what to do with the excess results in the excess being applied to the following month 's payment. Thus, you are paying interest, PMI, taxes and principal e.g. paying extra in XXXX pays the XXXX payment first before paying principal. 

The bank mitigates with the following : Monies in excess of the following month being paid are applied to principal as expected. 
One can call and change the application to principal only ( within 3 months of the transaction ). 

It is possible some consumers want to pay the next months bill. However, it does not make sense as it means paying interest that would be lowered by paying principal. Furthermore, looking at the First Mortgage / Deed of Trust contract, in section 2. Application of Payments or Proceeds we find the following : "" Such payments will be applied each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due. Any remaining amounts shall be applied first late charges, second to any other amounts due under this Security Instrument, and then to reduce the principal balance of the Note. '' Since my account was and is in good standing, payments should not go to anything other than principal."

Now through months and months, submitting and resubmitting paperwork numerous times, they refuse to help and have mismanaged servicing my mortgage over & over.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established rules to "" protect mortgage borrowers from costly surprises and runarounds by their servicers. '' 1024.41 ( b ) Receipt of Loss Mitigation application - "" A servicer shall exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information to complete a loss mitigation application. '' My mortgage was transferred from XXXX to Carrington in XXXX, XXXX and has been a nightmare since then attempting to work out something to lower my payments from $ XXXX./ mo. with an interest rate of 7 %. My income has decreased significantly since leaving the military but this whole thing could be resolved with a simple loan modification of the extremely high interest rate. Mortgage modification is a process where the terms of a mortgage are modified outside the original terms of the contract agreed to by the lender and borrower ( i.e. mortgagee and mortgagor ). In general, any loan can be modified, and the general process is referred to as loan modification or debt rescheduling. 

At one point I was told that if I paid {$3000.00}, they would reinstate the mortgage ; 2 weeks later that number had jumped to {$9000.00}, including late and legal fees. Although I was assigned someone to handle my file I could seemingly never talk to the same person twice. 1024.40 Continuity of contact - "" Servicers are required to maintain reasonable policies and procedures with respect to providing delinquent borrowers with access to personnel to assist them with loss mitigation options ''. Why was n't I assigned a single point of contact to assist me in saving my home? 

Not only have I undergone multiple submissions of documentation, countless phone calls with no return calls but have been spoken to rudely by people in their collection dept. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act FDCPA 806, Harassment or abuse 15 U.S.C. 1692d - Carrington Mortgage has been very rude and somewhat threatening when communicating with me regarding my mortgage.

I have done the right thing by my country and want Carrington to do the right thing by me and help me put this back on track so my family and I can get our lives together and have a mortgage payment that is affordable with an interest rate that is fair.

453589,Bank account or service,"SunTrust violates Section XXXX of the Federal Trade Commission Act XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ) by engaging in unfair billing practices related to incoming wire transfers. SunTrust disclosures do not fully inform customers of the {$15.00} incoming wire transfer fee and marketing materials furnished to the consumer on account opening do not disclose the service fee. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2016, SunTrust charged my checking account a {$15.00} service fee for a domestic, incoming wire transfer ( Fedwire ). The size of this service fee is excessive, causes substantial injury to consumers, is not outweighed by the benefit to consumers, and the consumer can not reasonably avoid the injury. 

The consumer can not avoid injury because they are not made aware of the service fee ahead of time and SunTrust exercises complete discretion is setting the charge. Please see the bank 's email message to me ( attached ). SunTrust writes, "" All service charges depend on banks [ sic ] discretion. '' Allowing SunTrust to impose charges based its "" discretion '' is arbitrary and capricious and unfair to consumers - particularly when that discretion is not clearly communicated to consumers in marketing materials and annual disclosure statements. Additionally, such discretion increases the risk of disparate impact and illegal discrimination. 

Please investigate SunTrust for violations of Section XXXX of the FTC Act as it relates to "" discretionary '' service fees charged to checking accounts."

Instead, they passed me around to numerous departments that had no idea how to process the refund and said I needed to speak to someone else. The final person I spoke to refused to do a refund. XXXX and chase conspired to prevent me from receiving a benefit they said I was entitled to by making it impossible to connect to the person that was handling it already and playing a game of pass the potatoe so that I would go away due to being annoyed and frustrated and they would keep the bag fee I should not have been assessed in the first instance.

164785,Consumer Loan,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX we leased a Kia Optima EX from XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. The salesman 's name was XXXX XXXX. He no longer works there. Once a price was agreed upon which was {$220.00} per month we began the paperwork process. We were informed of the basic lease information which we are familiar with as we have been leasing cars from various car brands for over 20 years. The one thing XXXX left out of his explanation of our obligation was the fact that Kia has an open-ended lease policy. Therefore, as we were signing papers and initialing away, at NO POINT was an open-ended lease policy explained to us and what that could possibly mean to us at the end of the lease term or if we decided to do an early lease termination, which I 've done in the past with other brands. When this has happened with other brands, we have had to pay the entire term of the lease off and in addition to that, we have had to pay a disposition fee which we know exists in almost all brands we 've ever leased, especially if we decided to lease from a different brand of car. We know that a way to avoid the disposition fee was to stay with the same brand and lease or buy from them again. I have no problem paying a disposition fee because I was made aware of it and I agreed to that knowingly. XX/XX/XXXX we decided to turn in the Kia Optima EX early and lease a Jeep Renegade. The lease was being turned in 6 months and 7 payments early. The Jeep was leased from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. My son was the person who leased this Jeep as he was the primary driver of the Kia and he was the one who paid off the lease and disposition fee for it. My complaint is technically about both of the above mentioned dealerships. We were 100 % lied to by both places, however the majority of my complaint is about XXXX XXXX. My son brought in his lease paperwork to XXXX XXXX and was then made aware that this was an open-ended lease but that after ALL the payments for the lease term were paid and the disposition fee was paid no further monies would be owed to Kia. He was promised that by the XXXX dealer. Once he had the word of the salesman XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX, XXXX we decided to move forward with the deal. The deal was made and then we received a letter from Kia Finance dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating that we owed them {$3100.00} early termination fee. They state in the letter that the car was valued at {$17000.00} but they auctioned it off for {$13000.00}. They credited us the payment they received from XXXX XXXX leaving us with a balance of {$3100.00}. XXXX XXXX also messed up because they never called XXXX XXXX for a payoff balance. They estimated he had 6 payments left when in fact it was 7 payments and the disposition fee was {$400.00} and they put in the XXXX paperwork it was {$390.00}. I know it is only a {$5.00} difference there but it shows me the incompetence of XXXX XXXX. I tried getting help from the finance person at the XXXX dealer who also happens to be the son of the owner, XXXX XXXX. He agreed that his salesperson XXXX XXXX was not forthcoming with my son and he was going to try and buy the car back so we would not have to pay XXXX the {$3100.00} since his employee messed up, Once XXXX could not get the car back, he told us he could n't do anything else for us and that my son signed the papers and that the "" real '' enemy here is XXXX XXXX. I also informed XXXX that XXXX XXXX did not send Kia the correct amount of a payoff and he shorted Kia one month 's payment and shorted them {$5.00} on the disposition fee and I thought I should get that money back. He told me "" no '' because even though his employee calculated wrong, once again, "" my son signed the papers. '' The Kia dealer wo n't help either. We were lied to by both dealers.

Capital One closed and charged off this account in XXXX after my job loss and my inability to make payments.

This reporting is simply erroneous as there is no way that I am still late on payments every month after this account has been charged off and closed. 

I called to tell Capital One that I would pay off the remaining charged off balance yesterday, as long as they properly updated that the errors would be corrected. I talked to a few representatives and they told me that there was nothing they would do for me because the reporting was correct. I find it impossible to believe that a closed account can still have payments reporting as late. 

Please investigate this. I am willing to pay Capital One every penny I owe them, as long as they delete my errors from my credit report. There are so many errors, that the best resolution would be for them to accept my payment in full for the {$390.00} balance I owe them and they could just remove my trade line permanently. 

I will be attaching screenshots from my XXXX credit monitoring report so you can see the discrepancies. Please investigate this because there is no consistency to the reporting errors and Capital One is still hurting my credit to this day on an account that has been closed for years."

722875,Debt collection,"In XXXX, 2015 I entered a written dispute with ARS ACCOUNT RESOLUTION SERVICES reference account numbers XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX as contained on my consumer credit profile at XXXX XXXX XXXX. Specifically alleged, ARS ACCOUNT RESOLUTION SERVICES was attempting to collect a debt for which I had no knowledge and alleged was potentially opened by an unknown third party. Moreover, said accounts were appearing twice on my consumer credit profile notwithstanding the allegation of a single debt owed. 

ARS ACCOUNT RESOLUTION SERVICES failed to investigate, verify, or validate said debt. Although I also filed a cease and desist demand with ARS ACCOUNT RESOLUTION SERVICES an absolute requirement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is to report said debt as disputed pending resolution of an investigation. ARS ACCOUNT RESOLUTION SERVICES failed to report said debt as disputed and failed to conduct an investigation into my allegations of potential fraud. As such, my credit worthiness has been negatively impacted by the erroneous reporting of these accounts. 

A review of records compiled by the XXXX Financial Services in Florida indicates that ARS ACCOUNT RESOLUTION SERVICES is not currently licensed to conduct business pursuant to section XXXX, Florida statute. As such, the imposition of this debt and the erroneous reporting to XXXX XXXX XXXX is an unfair and deceptive trade practice. 

Several phone calls to ARS ACCOUNT RESOLUTION SERVICES have met upon deaf ears. When I called to inquire on the status of the disputed account, I was advised that Florida licensing was not required. I was further advised that the debt remained due notwithstanding a lack of validation and claim of potential fraud. At this point the call was terminated. My written dispute remains outstanding. Said accounts remain on my XXXX XXXX XXXX notwithstanding the existence of a dispute, lack of validation, and my allegations of potential fraud."

There would not be an issue. This morning I woke up to XXXX worth of OD fees charged to my account. When I called and spoke with them they said that they couldnt see the checks coming through. I then asked why did they clear first if they were the last things to show up? She said they pay the higher amounts first and it trickles down. I explained that I was told yesterday bu XXXX that my account was fine. She said I was the only one who knew about the checks and there was nothing they could do. I have a real problem since I had money that could have been deposited to avoid this but I was told it would be ok. Also, because the checks coming through that werent seen were paid first. If they had gone in the order they received them I may not be so upset over the XXXX check fee but this is ridiculous. They say its ok and process however it profits them. I understand they are a business but they are a crooked practice that is unwilling to work with a customer that has been with them for year."

I have a bankruptcy, XXXX tax liens and a judgment listed on my Equifax credit file as a result of a business closing in 2009. My XXXX file also lists the bankruptcy and XXXX tax liens. None of the issues are on my XXXX file. The issue is that my former employers business debts, and taxes were added to my personal credit file after the business closed in 2009. I have tried unsuccessfully since 2009 to have the errors corrected. The XXXX ( California Tax department ) and original judgment creator ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) have tried numerous times to reverse the errors on my behalf. I have contacted Equifax and XXXX by phone, fax and mail, sent copies of my bankruptcy filing, and released tax liens, and the only responses from the bureaus was that the information was verified that it belonged to me. I can not dispute that the information belongs to me as it is associated with my social security number, even though the company that I worked for was a California Corporation. My dispute is that the debts were attached to me personally in error, forcing me to file bankruptcy."
496403,Bank account or service,"I opened a checking account with USAA to which I set up direct biweekly deposits in the amount of {$100.00} each. My wife was a joint account holder on the account. This account served as a "" sinking fund '' into which I put money aside ; there were no withdrawals, and so I did check the account balance until I was sure that a few direct deposits had been made. When I checked the balance, I discovered XXXX withdrawals totaling {$170.00} which I had not made. I knew that my wife, the joint account holder had not made these withdrawals. USAA 's customer service rep told me the funds had been withdrawn by the bank itself ( i.e. "" set off '' ) pertaining to an account held by my wife PRIOR to our marriage. Thus, USAA wrongfully set off the funds for a debt that was not legally mine because that debt arose prior to my marriage and can not legally be attached to me. Further, I do not live in a community property state."

PSC and Multi-care both denied that it was but I had medical proof that they knew but did not disclosed this to me or the court. I began to investigate this insane amount. my findings through doing a discovery with a legal aid service & L & I showed that Multi-care knew that most of my bills that I was being persuade for were in fact a claim from years ago.

This was included in my bankruptcy back that I filed XX/XX/XXXX and it clearly lists XXXX and another collection agency that was trying to collect the debt at the time.

695830,Student loan,"I was laid off by my employer in XXXX 2016 and filed for unemployment. In XXXX and XXXX 2016, I attempted to request a recalculation of my Income Based Repayment plan because my income had changed. Both requests were denied because I had checked the wrong checkbox on the form ; I still paid the bill amounts in full to show good faith and to remain in good standing. In XXXX when I was denied a second time I called the fedloan call center to request assistance with filling out the paperwork -- the operator at that time instead only outlined employment deferment as my sole option to remain in good standing with my student loans ; when I specifically explained that I no longer had income and needed my monthly payment recalculated, I could not get the information I needed to have my income-based repayments reconsidered. 
The 3rd attempt, filed online on XXXX XXXX, 2016, was processed on XXXX XXXX, 2016 at the central processing center. However, because my monthly payments are due on the XXXX of each month, I am still receiving requests and notifications that my XXXX payment is past due. I called the fedloan call center today to further request relief from the XXXX payment, but was told that my only options were to pay the bill or to go into forbearance. I explained to the operator that I had multiple attempts to make the request, but she bluntly explained that forbearance or full payment were my only options. 
My understanding of the income based repayment plan is that it allows for reconsideration of monthly payments based on someone 's income. My understanding is also that when someone fills out the online form ( as I did on XXXX ), the current balance is temporarily suspended until the request is processed. 
I believe that my request is being handled in an unfairly strict way. I filled out the online form before my bill was due on the XXXX, and I can also prove that I was laid off in XXXX and spent precious cash resources trying to stay current on my account even as I was requesting assistance from the operators because the paperwork was confusing to me, and therefore incorrectly filled out."

I never did get served this judgement so I was never able to see the paper work for this judgement. In this loan i had cosigned with my ex for a XXXX and a XXXX. in the paperwork they have the original paperwork stating these XXXX vehicles which they combined into XXXX loan for us. Both of these vehicles were both repossesed. In the judgement it states that it sold the XXXX for {$8000.00} and put that amount towards the balance that I owed. But it doesnt state the XXXX nor how much they sold it for. And if they did sell it that balance never went to the balance that I owe. So the amount is not accurate. I re read it several times and the XXXX was never sold. so they took the XXXX and did whatever they wanted and got away with it.

I recently went to a local branch and paid off XXXX of the XXXX accounts, about {$7000.00} of a total of {$23000.00} I owed. At the branch, the teller calculated that my new monthly payment, going forward, would be {$200.00}, which corresponds to what I calculated the new payment would be. 
A few days ago, I checked the institution 's website which states, instead, that my new payment will be {$230.00} ( previously, before paying off XXXX of the accounts, my monthly payment was {$270.00} ). I called the institution to ask them to correct the payment information on the website to align with what I was told at the branch and which I think is correct. I was told that the website amount, {$230.00}, is correct. I asked for a breakdown of the payment and was told that, for example, on # XXXX, my new principal payment would be about {$140.00}. But currently my principal payment for that account is only {$84.00}. I asked why my principal payment jumped from {$84.00} to {$140.00}, and the agent on the phone could n't give me an answer. I pointed out that, if I paid {$140.00} in principal every month on that account, I would pay it off way before the ten-year payback period ends. The agent on the phone could n't explain why this is so. 
In general, I told the agent that I could n't understand how it was that I paid off about 30 % of the total principal I owned but my monthly payment was going down ( according to the bank ) by only about 15 %. The agent could n't explain why this was. I think the institution is mistaken and needs to correct the monthly payment to align what I was told at the branch."

I felt that there was wrong information on my credit report so I challenged them. But what struck me was that the other bureaus removed the information I challenged. 
For some reason your company did not remove it. I 'm a little confused here. How is it that the other bureaus removed the inaccurate information and your company did not? I thought you were contacting the same furnisher about this inaccurate information. If the furnisher verified that the information was incorrect with the other bureaus, then why would they not do the same with your company? Are you sure you contacted them because this inaccurate information is stopping me from getting approved for credit, and I 'm starting to get upset. Believe me, it takes a lot to get me upset. I think your company made a mistake with this account given the fact that the other bureaus found that these accounts were inaccurate. Now, I 'm not a complainer, but I do need this fixed.

490130,Student loan,"I am a borrow that has followed all instructions in a timely fashion, desires to, and is able to make on time IBR payments. Despite this, my current loan holder 's unreasonable policies and inefficiency are preventing me from doing so. 

Here 's the background information. In XXXX, several of my loans were held by Fedloan while the remainder were with XXXX. Recertification for the year starting in XXXX XXXX was sent ( on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) to both XXXX and Fedloan. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX confirmed approval of IBR payment in the amount of {$280.00} to begin on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Upon submitting documentation for PSL around XXXX XXXX, I was notified that my remaining Navient loans would automatically be transferred to Fedloan ( making Fedloan the holder of all my loans ). 

This is where the problems began. On multiple occasions between XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I spoke with Fedloan representatives in response to several letters I received that stated I needed to complete recertification to remain on IBR. I was repeatedly told that my recertification information had been received but that it would not be processed until immediately prior to the XXXX statement. I also asked whether I should resubmit recertification due to my Navient loans being transferred and was told this was not necessary as XXXX would pass on all information. In XXXX XXXX, I received a statement for {$810.00} and was told that they had not received IBR recertification information from XXXX. Upon sending to Fedloan documents from XXXX confirming approval of IBR, I was told that because XXXX transferred the loans to Fedloan before my first recalculated IBR payment for the XXXX year, Fedloan was not obligated to this amount and I was therefore placed on the standard repayment plan. I questioned this process but also the amount of {$810.00} given that the XXXX calculator estimated standard payments of $ XXXX/mo ( depending on whether my spouses student loans were included in the estimate ), however, no one could address this discrepancy. When I asked to speak to a supervisor or third party that could address my complaint, I was told that there were no oversight agencies or personnel. They did say that they would leave a message for another FedLoan department to call me the next day at an agreed upon time, however, this call was never received and when I called to let them know I was waiting for this call, the person who answered was unable to appropriately direct me or answer my questions. 

I 've since completed a second recertification for IBR ( REPAYE plan ). Confirmation that steps were being taken to transition to REPAYE was received from FedLoan ( on XXXX ) and I was told that I would be placed on administrative forbearance for 1 month during which time I would need to make XXXX {$5.00} payment after which the REPAYE payment plan would go into effect for the subsequent period. I made this {$5.00} payment on time for the month of XXXX and am now being told that I must remain on forbearance and make another {$5.00} payment for the month of XXXX because they did not process the payment plan change in time. Upwards of 8 months ( or longer as this has yet to be resolved ) to process an IBR recertification request seems unreasonable. As part of the PSL program, I am eager to make payments that will count towards the program, yet Fedloan seems to be unreasonably slow and provides inaccurate information that interferes with making reasonable payments. They denied the request I made today to expedite the change in payment plan stating that they had already sent out statements and were unable to make any changes in payment amount once that has occurred. I 'd like you to be aware of these irresponsible practices and any advice to remedy the situation would be welcomed."

These people REFUSE to work out another temporary forbearance as I have already used mine up. But explain to me how having a forbearance, and a job out of college that pays poorly, prepares you to make {$800.00} a month payments? Also after the sub prime mortgage meltdown, I could not find a well paying job for almost two years. I am not trying to avoid paying my loan off, I am trying to avoid not being able to afford marriage, children or buying a house before I am XXXX and already close to retirement. All I want AES to do, is to lower my payment, which is now almost 30 % of my monthly income, soon to be close to 45 %, and/or give me another temporary "" hold '' on my loan payments to allow me to catch my breath at least."

My son pays the federal and I pay the private. The grace period was requested, however due to financial hardships the account was reported as 180 days past due in XXXX XXXX although over {$6000.00} was paid for XX/XX/XXXX. Regular monthly payments were made as coordinated with the NJCLASS telephone representatives. During a telephone conversation with a NJCLASS representative the amount disclosed for the payment was not clearly identified by myself after a number of confirmations. The confirmed amount that I recorded for the payment was {$1000.00} whereas the amount requested by XXXX XXXX was {$1900.00}. After numerous telephone calls to NJCLASS for the scheduled payment for a number of weeks, each representative informed that the recorded telephone conversation were being reviewed. All attempts to pay the approximately {$900.00} discrepancy were not accepted by NJCLASS representatives and internet access to the account was no longer available. I was never contacted concerning the discrepancy of {$1000.00} and {$1900.00} and the account was directly handed to collections, the attorney office. 
After the account was forwarded to collections, regular monthly payments of over {$14000.00} have been made on this account to collections, attorney office. A number of attempts have been made to refinance this account, however NJCLASS first listed on credit report as "" failure to pay '', however updated to "" In collections '' which a number of private loan financing with not process. I am still attempting to locate a reputable loan financing company that will process this private student loan. The collections, attorney office, charges additional interest daily which has increased the loan to over {$200000.00}. My issue is the account should have never been forwarded to collections due to the miscommunication in the payment and no consideration was given to allow me provide the amount requested."

82193,Student loan,"I attempted to get my college education for the first time in 2009, and that 's when I had to borrow from XXXX, which is now Navient. Well at least that 's who is servicing my loans now. I can honestly say that it was the worst mistake of my life. I should have never started business with them or I should have never started college, but I did n't know any better because I was only XXXX years old and had no clue about student loans. They gave me a private loan which they called a "" Smart Option '' student loan, however it was anything but smart. At first I had to borrow {$17000.00} for my tuition balance at University XXXX. The company approved my loan, and gave me 12 % interest rate, and made me pay "" interest only '' monthly payments while I was in schools and working part-time. For the next semester I had to borrow again, and mistakenly and regretfully my parents made me go back and borrow more from XXXX. This time I was short {$5800.00} for the tuition. XXXX approved my loan at 11.75 % interest rate with the same conditions as I mentioned above. I had such a hard time being able to come up with my payments that it caused me to drop out and forget about pursuing me dream and getting higher education. I said to myself that I would never borrow private student loans again. For some reason, the whole time I made payments and paid thousands of dollars in interest, neither of my loans went down even by a dollar. When I stopped making payments it was because I was n't able to afford them and paid only what I could at the time. One day I get a notice that XXXX became Navient or at least transferred my loans to them. I began getting numerous phone calls per day to my cell phone from Navient harassing me and asking me for money. I called Navient numerous times asking them to work with me, to lower my payments or at least interest rates but they kept insisting that "" there is nothing that they can do for me ''. I was told that to even consider lowering my interest rates, the company would need to pull my credit and affect my credit rating even more. The last time I checked my statement I saw that my interest rates were increased for some reason instead of being lowered, but no one needed my credit to do that? or even notified me? I 'm unable to afford $ XXXX/month when I 'm a student and also working as much as I can just to have the means to live. Now, because of this awful organization, my credit is ruined and I have someone harassing me for money on the phone all the time. My loans went from the {$17000.00} that I originally borrowed to {$19000.00} and the second went from XXXX one is {$6400.00}. Additionally, Navient charged me a lot of late fees which made loans even higher. This is even after I already paid XXXX of dollars in interest rates. 12.375 % and 12.625 % interest rates for these kind of loans, especially for student loans is way to excessive. This company is ruining my life by not letting me to have the chance on paying off these loans. I will never be able to pay these loans off unless something different happens. This is the worst financial organization in the United States, and I 'm praying to XXXX that our government will finally step in and do something about these unfair practices. Unless something happens, the student loan debt will continue to increase as well as college drop out numbers. Please assist me with this and finally help me with this huge burden."

407758,Credit reporting,"I have not received a final response from Equifax because they are not responding to me. After months of attempting to obtain my credit report, I have heard nothing since submitting copies of my identification over XXXX weeks ago. 

I have received multiple notifications from merchants that my credit card information has been compromised and have been attempting for months to get a copy of my credit report. The credit reporting agencies appear to be manipulating the system to make it very difficult actually to receive a report. First, I attempted to get a credit report from the website. One of the required questions was the exact amount of the payment on a car loan that was paid off more than ten years ago. Next, I attempted to order a report by telephone and was told by the system that I had to write in. Then, I wrote in and eventually received a form letter claiming that my address was unknown. My address is a house that I own and have carried a mortgage on for XXXX years ; the mortgage itself - with my home address - is surely on my credit report. The response is wholly implausible. Nevertheless, I wrote in over a month ago ( XX/XX/XXXX ) providing, as requested, a copy of my driver 's license and my Social Security card. I have received no response. 

Equifax 's conditioning the required free credit report on information no one would reasonably be expected to possess ( the amount of the monthly payment on a loan closed for over a decade ), the claim that easily verifiable information ( the address of a house on which I have had a mortgage since 2002 and for which I have all the standard utility accounts ), and the failure to respond even after I have provided all requested documentation following multiple attempts over months - all while I have been told by credit card processors that my information has been compromised and I should check my credit reports immediately - is inexcusable and, taken together, raises strong inferences of a deliberate attempt to comply in form with the requirement to provide credit reports while in practice making it as difficult and burdensome as possible to obtain those reports. I also note that I have been offered "" credit monitoring '' and other paid services along the way ( for example, "" Equifax Complete '' ). I suggest that the credit bureaus be prohibited from offering paid consumer credit monitoring services in order to remove the obvious conflict of interest giving them every incentive to make it difficult for consumers to obtain the statutorily mandated free reports and drive them to the paid services."

After signing, I misplaced the coupons and asked my broker to re-send them via email, which he did. I paid my XXXX payment on time using the coupons he emailed me. 

In XXXX, HomeBridge called me to inform me that I was late on my payment and they were "" attempting to collect a past due debt ''. They called me on my work phone line. I asked them to call back on my cell phone. I ended up spending around 45 minutes talking to someone about my mortgage. He told me that I owed them {$1100.00}, which was disconcerting because it was significantly lower than expected. I asked them if they had setup my impound account to pay taxes and home insurance. He said they had not and that I would have to fax my tax documents and my insurance documents to XXXX separate departments! I immediately called my broker from XXXX XXXX, and he said to ignore them and wait for my welcome packet in the mail sometime in XXXX and to continue paying to the coupons he sent me. 

I paid my XXXX bill promptly on the XXXX of the month. Then on the XXXX of XXXX, I received another call from HomeBridge saying I was late on my XXXX payment, but they had received my XXXX payment.

Again, I was at work. Again, it took about 40 minutes. Then I just received another call today! The woman who I spoke to on Friday apparently did n't take very diligent notes. 

This process is a waste of my time and is a huge disturbance at work. I feel harassed to talk to these incompetent people out of fear that they will mistakenly report a missed mortgage payment to the credit bureau. I want to emphasize that I have followed all directions that were given to me and both of my payments were cashed. This process has been sloppy and jarring. HomeBridge should be seriously reprimanded for their disorganized practice and harassment of new mortgage holders."

I was told that because I had had a similar card in the last 24 months that I was n't eligible for the miles. If this was the case then why did CitiBank send me the offer in the first place? When I applied online why did n't the system tell me that I was n't eligible? I would n't have taken the card without the bonus miles. This seems like a scam to me.

556105,Mortgage,"When applying for a mortgage through Quicken loans I was misadvised by the underwriter XXXX XXXX. During a telephone conversation XXXX advised that I would need a letter or relocation in order to continue with the loan. I told XXXX I would not have that for some time, since I was not relocating for 6 months. XXXX advised me to replied to his email and state what we discussed on the phone and outline my relocation. I did so only to receive an email from him that Quicken needed this on company letterhead. I reluctantly troubled my boss for the letter and sent it to XXXX. XXXX then replied that the letter needed to be signed. I again troubled my boss to sign the letter he had drafted. I feel that the underwriters should know the requirements of the documents that they are requesting. I feel that XXXX was just guessing, this caused frustration and wasted my time, my boss 's time and XXXX 's time."

346039,Consumer Loan,"Back in XXXX I was made aware that Exeter Finance Corp reported my account delinquent 30 days or more past due for my XXXX & XXXX 2015 payment. I called and spoke with a CSR and through that conversation realized that they were missing a payment that I made. I was told that I need to send documentation of the payment being cleared. Within a week I sent in my bank statement showing the payment was made with my debit card and cleared. I continued to follow up on the status of the update for weeks and was unsuccessful. Thirty days past and finally I decided to report the company to the XXXX and I filed a complaint. After a couple back and fourth responses the company applied my missing payment to my Exeter Finance Account. As I was going through that ordeal the company again reported my account past due for XXXX & XXXX although I made my payment for XXXX was granted a three month extension for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ( which I later found out was not true, I was only granted a two month extension therefore the CSR provided me false information ). I called again asking what was this about and was told this time that the wrong payment information was given and that my payment did not clear the bank. I have a letter from my bank as well as my bank statement for the month in question of the payment. Not only was there sufficient funds for the payment to have cleared the account, my bank has provided me with a letter stating that there was no attempt that came through from Exeter Finance to obtain payment. I repeatedly ask for Exeter to update my credit file as to not being past due because again as with my misapplied payment that caused this issue from the beginning there was clearly an issue processing my XXXX payment as well. I have been unsuccessful in getting this issue rectified. It is simply not fair that a company can make a mistake no fault to the consumer and there is nothing that the consumer can do to protect their credit history. I have actual documentation, all I have heard from them are words filled with inaccuracy but they have yet to provide me with the information of what account number they allegedly attempted to process my payment. It could have been a case of system or human error that process the wrong information, however that is no fault to me the consumer and I should not have to reap the negative consequence of it. I have the responses made from the company Exeter through the XXXX that are filled with errors of information of what took place and dates as well. I simply want the company to retract the reporting of XXXX XXXX payment being over 30 days past due. They have made several errors and this has gone way too far at this point with no resolution. In addition to all of this, after requesting a ledger of statement account of my payment history, it took the company over 45 days to send it to me. That was just unacceptable."
631510,Student loan,"I was never contacted by XXXX or Nelnet that my loans were in default. I was under the assumption that since I had recently stopped going to school, my loans were not yet due. I was never sent statements or received phone calls regarding payment for my student loan. Once I found out that the loans were in default, I was never offerred a restructuring or forgiveness for my lates. I took the effort upon finding out how dire the situation was and consolidated under XXXX. They have since paid both XXXX and Nelnet in full. All I am asking both XXXX and Nelnet to do is to remove the late payments on my credit bureau report since I was not made aware the laons were due and in default, they had an incorrect address for me, and upon finding out about the default, neither of them offerred me a restructuring or forgiveness. I have sent numerous emails, letters, and made numerous phone calls to both and they are both unwilling to work with me due to their error."

I requested that TransUnion take my credit report and show me how they arrived at my XXXX credit score. My score goes down each month. I have had no credit inquires. My credit use is the same each month, with no balances. TransUnion has failed to provide this information. Credit scoring discriminates against senior citizens who have generations of good credit history but no longer have loans, mortgages or carry credit card balances. The credit reporting and scoring companies will not and can not explain how my personal credit score is determined and why it continues to go down. This score impacts negatively on the rates I pay for insurance. Credit scoring companies force citizens to have a credit score that impacts their financial transactions but they will not and can not take an individuals credit report and explain how the credit score is calculated or why it continues to fall when there have been no credit transactions."

426180,Debt collection,"Filed against : National Credit Systems , Inc . 
XXXX XXXX XXXX GA XXXXComplaint Description : The National Credit Systems , Inc. states that I owe on account # XXXX a total of {$3600.00}. The account in question is from an apartment that had an agreement terminated XX/XX/XXXX. I discovered this debt by checking my credit report and inquiring about it. On my credit it shows as debt owed beginning XX/XX/XXXX, however it should be changed to the correct date of XX/XX/XXXX. No attempt has ever been made to reach me regarding this debt that began XX/XX/XXXX. I had cosigned for an apartment for a friend of mine and was never notified of the failure to pay a debt. The person who rented the apartment, informed the apartment management that she was unable to afford the apartment and that she would be terminating the agreement early. She was told that if she left within three days that she would only be charged the early termination fee of {$2400.00} and no other fees. She left within three days per their agreement and made an arrangement to pay {$100.00} per month until the debt was paid off. In addition to the deposit on the apartment that paid off {$220.00} toward the termination fee, she made one payment of {$100.00} XX/XX/XXXX and did not make payments afterward. Once I found out about my credit score I called National Credit Systems to resolve issue. They state that instead of the {$2400.00} ( minus the {$100.00} payment and the {$220.00} deposit ), we also owe {$1200.00} for less than 60 day notice, pro-rated rent at {$32.00}, {$180.00} for cleaning charges, {$3.00} in damages, and {$19.00} in water/sewage which brings us to a total of {$3900.00} ( minus the {$220.00} deposit ). We should not have to pay the {$1200.00} for not giving 60 days notice as the arrangement with management was to leave within 3 days to avoid these charges, and she met that arrangement. In addition to the complaints, I have contacted this company and was met with extreme hostility. They yell over me when I merely ask questions regarding this debt which is news to me. They hang up on me frequently. They are rude, condescending, and insulting. At this point, when I call them they simply put me on hold until they eventually hang up on me. The company agreed to consider the debt settled at XXXX % ( {$2500.00} ), and yet when I asked for that agreement to be made in writing prior to payment, they refused saying that I must take their oral agreement and nothing else. I do not trust them to keep their agreement without seeing something in writing. To reiterate, I would like National Credit Systems , Inc. to provide to the three credit reporting agencies the actual beginning date of this debt XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX that they reported previously. I would also like the agreement they made with me at considering this debt settled at XXXX % to be put in writing prior to payment. 

Desired Resolution : I would like National Credit Systems , Inc. to provide to the XXXX credit reporting agencies the actual beginning date of this debt XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX that they reported previously. I would also like the agreement they made with me at considering this debt settled at XXXX % to be put in writing prior to payment."

34346,Debt collection,"LVNV/Resurgent is XXXX again continuing to violate the FDCPA requirements for validating the alleged debt ; the most important being the original alleged creditor 's contract with my signature ( or at least a certified copy of the original contract ( certified by the original creditor 's custodian of records ) ). My original Debt Validation Letter lists this request, as well as requests for a letter of assignment from the alleged original creditor ( evidence that the collection agency owns the alleged debt ) and the exact calculations supporting the alleged debt amount. Again, they continue to ignore these XXXX specific requests. LVNV/Resurgent lacks sufficient information and belief in order for me to admit or deny this alleged debt.

Until LVNV/Resurgent provides the original alleged creditor 's contract with my signature ( or at least a certified copy of the original contract ( certified by the original creditor 's custodian of records ) ), their basis is on a contract that is an adhesion contract and a contract that is illusory and therefore unenforceable. And where is the calculation of interest? The calculation stated in their response is usurious or based on a rate that is greater than allowed by law. 

I respectfully ask LVNV/Resurgent XXXX again to provide the XXXX specific items noted in this response and again following : - the original alleged creditor 's contract with my signature ( or at least a certified copy of the original contract ( certified by the original creditor 's custodian of records ) ) - the letter of assignment from the alleged original creditor ( evidence that the collection agency owns the alleged debt ) - the exact calculations supporting the alleged debt amountIn closing, I would like to publicly invoke the Doctrine of Unclean Hands as LVNV/Resurgent acted in a dishonest or fraudulent matter with respect to the dispute at hand in this situation."

90951,Mortgage,"Hello!  In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a loan modification at the encouragement of Ocwen to assist with lowering my mortgage payment.  I was told I would have to do a trial period from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, which I completed successfully.  After this, I was told I would received permanent loan modification.  It took 3 months for Ocwen to send me the new terms and conditions of the loan, which had to be notarized.  I completed the paperwork and sent it back.  2 months later (in XX/XX/XXXX), I received a phone call indicating that the paperwork was rejected due to the co-borrower not signing (my ex husband).  I was very upset by this because my ex husband and I have been divorced XX/XX/XXXX.  He signed a quit claim deed back over to me and I sent that, along with my divorce decree to Ocwen the year we divorced.  I think the mortgage company was GMAC at the time.  Regardless, I resent the quit claim deed and Ocwen was able to find my divorce decree.  At this time, I contacted the Ombudsman through Ocwen.  They offered to have a notary come to me to resign the paperwork.   The notary came to my work and I completed the paperwork and then received a call a few days later that it had been rejected due to not signing correctly.  I was told that I needed to sign the paperwork with my married name, and then aka with my current last name, as it appeared on my quit claim deed.  The notary who came out initially was given the wrong direction and while meeting with me, called for clarification.  When this was rejected, I received another call from Ocwen and they sent another notary out to my home. This was on XX/XX/XXXX.  While there, she wanted me to sign the paperwork with my legal name and no aka.  I told her no, that was wrong, but she didn't have any further instruction.  After she left my house, I received a phone call from the title company who sent her and I let them know what happened and they called the notary back to my house and I signed the paperwork the way I was supposed to.  3 weeks later, I receive a phone call from Ocwen, and they tell me that the paperwork was rejected, as of XX/XX/XXXX, and I need to have the co-borrower sign!  They are referring to my ex husband and here we are back to square one.  I am going in circles with them.  I almost had XXXX on the phone with them and immediately called the Ombudsman again.  I am waiting for a call back now.  I am so frustrated because this has affected my credit score, as Ocwen is reported my account to be delinquent, as this has not been updated to the credit bureaus.   I have a 592 credit score because of them and there is absolutely nothing I can do, which is why I am reaching out to you.  If there is anything you can do to expedite this and to right the wrong they have done with my credit score, I would appreciate it.  I am a hard working person, I don't qualify nor want any state aid.  I have a good job.  I just fell behind due to my divorce.  This modification is taking 9 months now.  This is so unfair.

Nowhere in my first contact with Carrington was I told that my account will have been considered past due beginning on XX/XX/XXXX when Carrington did not even have my loan information. Nowhere did they mention that debt collection activity would take place on this account with direct threats to foreclose on my property. I was provided with incomplete and misleading information by Carrington and then was harassed by their debt collectors. Sometime in XX/XX/XXXX Carrington sent me a letter regarding their intent to begin foreclosure on my property if no payment was received by XX/XX/XXXX which is six days earlier than the date I was promised I did not need to make payments by. I immediately called in and make a payment for the full past due amount. Next, after making this payment in full I received TWO certified letters that were received at the XXXX post office the week of XX/XX/XXXX stating that Carrington was intending to foreclose on my property. The letters were dated both XX/XX/XXXX. I find it absolutely mind blowing how it could take a letter over one month to arrive at my home address and the fact that there were two of these things just provides me with even more belief that this company has poor data organization mechanisms in place. After receiving these two letters I was beside myself and called to speak to a manager. I first spoke to a woman by the name of XXXX who said she can get me to a XXXX, I asked once again to speak to a manager not another phone representative but was told they have a "" Process '' in place they need to follow. XXXX also told me that Carrington accessed a {$20.00} property inspection fee on my condo for the late payments that I was made to believe were in a grace period. She transferred me to XXXX who was not able to provide me with much help other than explaining the first consumer contact that I had on XX/XX/XXXX would be reviewed. I kept asking to speak to a manager and finally was transferred to XXXX who sounded like he could care less to speak to me and said the {$20.00} property inspection fee could not be waived unless I send in a signed letter to start a dispute. I kept asking for the call to be reviewed while I waited but was told that was not possible. I told XXXX that he was not helping me and he stated that he was in the most careless tone."
482399,Credit card,"This complaint is to serve, dispute and document the bad business practices by XXXX XXXX and as well Synchrony Bank who handles the collection efforts of XXXX XXXX. Under the Federal Trade Commission and as well in the State of California they are to properly notify me of any changes to the account which the failed to do. We had bought a mattress on a three year loan in which according to them after that would incur three years of interest if it was not paid within that three years. 

Due to financial troubles we had fallen behind on payments and had notified them as such and nothing was done. XXXX years had gone by and the next phone call was that we owed triple the amount. We had sent four letters of request to pay original amount and there was no response. We had spoken on numerous occasions to managers notifying them and as well their mangers acknowledging that we should have been notified but yet no arrangement was made. So even after acknowledging fault by XXXX XXXX managers, four letters, numerous calls they failed to provide us with a solution other than a penalty. 

I wish for this account to be cleared off my account and as well the company notified of their wrong doings."
412896,Credit card,"Below is my complaint I filed with Synchrony Bank and I have not got a resolution to their fraudulent billing. 
I have filed a formal complaint with the associated agencies regarding my account and experience. You are illegally billing me for almost {$800.00} that I did not receive. 
I am writing this letter and forwarding it as this is the last straw. I have spoken to numerous people to include Supervisors and Managers at Synchrony Bank. I have spoken to a bunch of dismissive, rude, patronizing and unhelpful people. This will be my final attempt to get this issue correct and resolved however ; I am forwarded to all media sites and outlets. I am waiting for someone to take ownership of this issue and call me back expeditiously. I WILL NOT BE PAYING YOU XXXX 2 TIMES FOR XXXX TVs WHEN I ONLY RECEIVED XXXX. FIX MY BILLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I applied for and received an immediate credit approval for {$900.00}. 
I placed a site to store order for a XXXX '' XXXX Smart HDTV at the location address of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Virginia XXXX On XXXX/XXXX/2016 - I attempted to pick the order up at the location but was advised the TV was not in stock. 
I asked a sales person at the XXXX, Va location to contact the XXXX XXXX, Virginia location at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, Virginia XXXX to determine if the TV was in stock. 
I was advised it was and they had several. 
My husband and I went to that location to get the TV which was XXXX minutes away. 
When we arrived to the store to attempt to purchase the TV at the XXXX XXXX, Virginia location, the purchase would not go through. 
I contacted Synchrony Bank and I explained the issue and that I was at another location. 
The representative explained that because my limit was {$900.00} the site to store purchase was still showing. She stated she would have to cancel that order since it took the majority of my limit and it would release the funds so I can actually purchase the TV at the XXXX XXXX, Virginia location. Authorized code # XXXX. 
The bank representative did exactly that and I was able to purchase the TV from the XXXX XXXX, Virginia location. 
In XXXX 2016, I received a bill from your bank with XXXX charges for the TV which was XXXX each. 
I disputed the charges, conferenced the site to store location ( XXXX, Virginia ) Manager in with Synchrony bank to verify I had not received the TV, spoke to 6 Managers, called no less than 10 times, spoke to rude and patronizing customer service representative as well as supposed Managers ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. ), I was made to wait 60 days for a response. All to get a resolve to my dispute as the charge for the XXXX XXXX, Virginia location was valid which was never the charge in question. The charge/TV in question that was supposed to be in dispute was for the site to store location in XXXX, Virginia. 
On XXXX/XXXX/2016 after receiving a letter from you all advising my charge was valid and sent me a copy of my receipt where I signed, I called to advise the incorrect charge was disputed. 
I asked for a Supervisor. I received XXXX who stated he was a Manager however he was so rude, patronizing and spoke over me multiple times. 
I asked for a member of management over him and I had to ask a minimum of 6 times and he then made it difficult for me to get the next level of management. 
After screaming at the top of my lungs for him to transfer me, he transferred me to XXXX. 
XXXX was USELESS!! He refused to give me the next level of management and frustrated me to no end looking for a reason to hang up and I became irate and with perfect timing he disconnected the call. 
I am not sure why this is not fixed! I am challenging you all to pay almost {$800.00} for something you never received and to be okay with that. I do n't know why no one"

They responded to my request on XX/XX/2017 and were not able to furnish a Chain of Title and therefore were not able to prove they own any debt of which I am obligated to pay. Upon the receipt of their response, I immediately sent their letter in its entirely along with my own letter to the credit agencies demanding that they remove this mortgage/collection account from my credit report. I actually sent XXXX letters, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. In that letter I stated that due to the fact that XXXX could not establish a document that stated that they owned anything of which I was liable, that this needed to be immediately deleted from my credit report and if not it was in violation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I received my results from the credit agencies within the 30 days, and though they deleted the activity contained in the XXXX account, the account still remains on my report as a collection and has not been deleted, which is still the only thing preventing me from obtaining my loan."

There is also wrong information about the date a will finish paying my loan. I have not asked for a deferred payment plant since the beginning of my loan. Thus, I do not understand why Citifinancial is showing the last payment of my loan to be 6 month after the actual date it shows as the last date to be paid off.

I immediately mailed my key to XXXX, who has possession of the vehicle, along with a copy of this form and the notes above the line.

Instead she kept asking for my father. When I would n't disclose if I knew him or not she hung up on me. At this point I was curious as to who was calling soliciting information about my father so I called the number back and asked where I had called. The representative told me I was calling Glass Mountain Capital. I went online to see what this was and found out that it was a debt collector. 

My issue here is the fact that after various inquiries, the debt collector failed to disclose the fact that she was a debt collector. If I had n't called the number back, I never would have known it was an attempt to collect a debt."

After careful consideration, we decided to build our dream home and use my VA loan for the first time ( 11 year and XXXX XXXX veteran ). We decided to use AmeriPro as our mortgage lender after being referred from a friend and seeing a positive record of being Veteran friendly. In XXXX XXXX, AmeriPro gave us a conditional approval and the builder decided to build our dream home. During the next few months, I personally worked hard to make sure we hit every single condition. Over those months, we were occasionally assured by AmeriPro that everything was on track to close on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AmeriPro contacted us and stated my wife had to be on the job for six months before we could close ... Although this was very frustrating in the last minute notification, we understood the oversight and decided to wait out the remaining month until she hit her six month mark at her current employer ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX was the six month mark ). We contacted our rental agency and placed our 30 day notice, being assured there was no reason why we should n't be able to close in XXXX. We were told now that XXXX XXXX would be our closing and nothing should prevent us from closing on that date. Ten days before closing ( XXXX XXXX ) we were confirmed to still close on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. A week before closing, the bottom fell out from underneath us, AmeriPro called and said there was no way to close on the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX because the VA required my wife to be on the job for a year. We pleaded that this was NEVER part of the conditions list and that we were now at risk of losing everything ... our {$10000.00} deposit, our current home ( rental ), the rental deposit, additional moving expenses and .... our dream home. AmeriPro apologized, but said there was nothing they could do and it was an oversight on their part. The piece that made this so frustrating is AmeriPro did n't care that a US Veteran was going to be homeless with his family and took ZERO accountability for their mistake or lack of professionalism and communication. On XXXX XXXX, my family and I were forced to move in with relatives, rush to get our furniture placed into storage and take on additional expenses. The lack of accountability and communication from AmeriPro is totally unacceptable. At a minimum, AmeriPro should have offered to come up with another solution, pay for the additional moving expenses and temporary housing ( at least 2-3 months ). I would hate to see anyone go through something like this as I 'm sure the mortgage industry is not set up to see people frustrated and homeless."

If your certified employment begin date is on or before XX/XX/XXXX, only the portion of your employment that falls after this date qualifies for PSLF Program purposes. 
The number of qualifying payments you have made during the qualifying employment period listed below, the total number of qualifying payments you have made during all periods of qualifying employment approved as of the date of this letter, the number of payments that are still required before you can apply for the forgiveness program, and the date you are expected to be eligible to apply for forgiveness are on the back of this letter.

A final determination of your eligibility for forgiveness will occur upon receipt of your application. 
While applying for and receiving forgiveness, you must continue full-time employment with a qualifying public service organization while making on-time qualifying payments under one of the approved repayment plans until you have received notice that you may cease making payments on your Direct Loans. 
Things to Remember Although we will maintain copies of any documents that we receive, we recommend that you keep copies of all forms that you submit and any supporting documentation regarding your employment and the PSLF Program.

Unfortunately that phone was stolen/lost by a fellow employee and I had documentation from XXXX to verify, it was ultimately reported as lost to the company and my superiors in a timely manner. I was told by my manager to open another line, as I would n't be eligible for employee discounts if I fully cancelled my original account for 3 to 6 months. I was instructed to use my social security number to open another type of employee discount account and did so without issue. I used this new account until I parted ways with the company. I was informed that all employee accounts would be terminated upon my leaving and that all devices had to be returned. I left my phone at my store location with my manager and called into employee care to verify the information he had given me, which they did. 

Nearly a year later I requested a credit check and saw that I had been sent to collections over a debt with XXXX. When I called in to see where the debt had originated I was bounced back and forth between XXXX and XXXX as neither said they could help me ; XXXX XXXX because I was a consumer, and XXXX because I had been an employee for the duration of my account. 

My current position allowed me to open an employee line with XXXX although they are NOT my employer, and I used this opportunity to begin a dialogue with someone who could possibly work on clearing up this debt from within the company. After weeks of telephone and email correspondence with the gentleman, I was offered the ability to pay off the debt and then be immediately reimbursed the money if I opened another account with XXXX.

181244,Consumer Loan,"In XXXX of XXXX I leased a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I began having problems with the vehicle in XXXX XXXX. Specifically, jumps while switching gears and gets stuck in gear XXXX. The problem mainly occurs when the car is switching gears from XXXX to XXXX and XXXX to XXXX. The car jumps so much when shifting that it is hard to control. When the car gets stuck in XXXX gear the engine revs but does not shift out of gear. I began taking the car to the dealer ; however, the problem was never fixed. The claim was that they could not duplicate the problem. On XXXX XXXX I took the car into service and provided the dealer as well as XXXX with videos showing the issue that I am complaining about. Also I provided copies of other driver 's experience with this issue and I have described the issue in detail with the hope that the issue will finally be resolved. Additionally, I told the service manager that the issue appears to be software related specifically it is either malicious or incorrect code in the vehicle software. On XXXX XXXX after 53 days in the shop and XXXX miles on vehicle they returned it saying they could find nothing wrong with the car so no repairs were done. Upon return of the vehicle I noticed that the service report for the XXXX XXXX service was incorrect. The report stated that my car had only been in the shop from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX and there were no miles put on it while it was in service, which is false. I pointed these errors out to the dealer who noted the inaccurate information. Since then, the car has been in the shop 3 additional times for the same issue and nothing has resolved it. Accordingly, the vehicle meets the statutory requirements to be deemed a lemon and repurchased by the manufacturer. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX made an offer to repurchase the vehicle and give me {$1500.00} towards a new C-Class. However, on Monday XXXX XXXX, XXXX they reneged. Since reneging on the offer the vehicle has been in the shop 3 to 4 additional times for the same issue. XXXX has ignored every correspondence and notice that they have received about the vehicle. They have also refused to keep the vehicle until they figure out what is wrong with it and provide alternate transportation. As it stands the car is unsafe to drive, however, I have no choice because they reneged on their offer and as a consequence I am paying for a vehicle and its use is substantially impaired."
168362,Bank account or service,"To whom this may concern, I am in a bit of a unique situation that has severely limited my access to financial services and I am writing this complaint in hopes that a solution can be reached. 

By way of background, here is the problem : I am currently located in XXXX but receive physical checks from my freelancing work. These physical checks are delivered to my US address, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, California, XXXX because international mail is both expensive and inconsistent. While I previously had these checks sent to directly to my US bank account, my bank decided, for unknown reasons to close my bank account. As a result, I have been unable to cash about 6 months worth of checks and have been having significant financial troubles. While I could resolve this situation by traveling back to the US and opening up another bank account I am prohibited from doing so because of the associated cost. Despite having over one thousand dollars in soon-to-be stale checks in the US, I am unable to access any of the monies from those checks. 

I am writing this complaint in hopes that Bank Of America will provide me with a detailed response on how I can get those checks cashed and gain access to the monies. Thus far I have tried : 1. ) Giving my mother, who is receiving the checks at my former US address, a Durable Power Of Attorney. The bank refused to honor this Power Of Attorney despite it being fully signed and executed. The bank states that I must have the Power Of Attorney notarized, however, XXXX is not a signatory to the XXXX and thus is not allowed to do international notarization. At the same time, the US Consulate provides notarization services but traveling to and from the US Consulate and paying the notarization fee is beyond my financial means. 
2. ) Other means such as sending the checks to XXXX, signing the checks, then sending them back to the US and then having my mother deposit the now endorsed check. It works but because of the shipping times involved, some of the checks become stale dated and expired, thus limiting my ability to gain access to my funds. On top of this, the additional shipping costs are unreasonable for small dollar checks. 

In review of the California Statutes regarding notarization as listed here : XXXX I would like to inquire if the bank with allow a signed power of attorney with XXXX witness signatures, in accord with Section 4122. Please promptly advise and I will have a Power Of Attorney signed with XXXX signatures made available to the bank for review. 

Finally, in review of the CFPB guidance regarding POAs and similar options listed here : XXXX and XXXX, I would like the bank to explain if there is any other method, option, or service that could allow me, or a family member acting on my behalf to cash the checks. 

You may call me at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or contact me directly at XXXXXXXXXXXX Sincerely Yours , XXXX XXXX XXXX"
104733,Debt collection,"I was notified by the payroll dept that my wages were going to be garnished regarding a filed judgement. After contacting the representative of the creditor, we agreed on a lump sum plus monthly payments. I never knew that I had a court date for this matter, so I asked for all documentation. He could not supply me with that, and advised me to get that from the court. However, I also asked to receive written notification of our agreement, as well as written monthly statements showing payments and current balances. The legal clerk said that that could not be provided, although if I paid over the phone by electronic check I could get balances each time. I was also not notified of the date of the last payment on the card, which was approximately in 2005. I am now aware of statute of limitations in collection matters. As a debtor, I have rights as well, and I believe that I am entitled to receive the written documents that I have requested. I was a paralegal for 12 years, and did the billing for my department. We represented banks and credit agencies, and we sent monthly statements to debtors paying on collections. If I am paying this large amount of money, I would like to see monthly statements."

It has been a couple of months and I have yet to see my credit. At this point I do not know where to turn I am XXXX yrs of age XXXX and I feel my bank has not helped me at all regarding this fraudulent charge. I have never heard of this company before until it showed up on my bill. I thought that I understood the law enough to feel that I was not liable for fraudulent charges to my account possibly due to identity theft. It seems Fulton Bank either feels otherwise or is not adhering to the law.

I am currently out of the country and have been for several months and therefore I have not received any mail nor were any messages provided to me that claims department needed additional information. This reversal caused my checking account to be overdrawn and I suffered a series of overdraft charges as a result. Curious why Wells Fargo reversed this or asking for notarized statements, etc. since this is pretty straightforward : I closed the Wells Fargo IRA so what sense does it make for me to still be deducting funds from my checking account to continue to place funds into an Wells Fargo IRA that I closed and no longer exists? Now I have been chasing a moving target of notarized statements and poor customer service ( you can read the email thread I am enclosing as an attachment ).

265677,Mortgage,"Here is the background of this transaction : There are XXXX units in the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Because more than half of the units are rented, federally-guaranteed mortgage financing is not available to unit buyers. Moreover, XXXX XXXX is in need of costly building repairs that can no longer be deferred. As a result, the market value of XXXX XXXX XXXX units has been severely depressed, and the only recent sales of XXXX XXXX units have been for cash and at deeply discounted prices. I and many other XXXX XXXX owners have been trying to sell our units, but we have not been able to do so without selling for a below-market price. 

Faced with this situation, XXXX XXXX hired a broker to find a buyer interested in buying our entire building - that is, all XXXX units and all of the common elements -- and then de-converting our condominium to a non-condominium apartment building pursuant to Section XXXX of the Illinois Condominium Property Act. Section 15 authorizes transactions of this type, and Section 15 requires that every owner must sell his or her unit when a bulk unit sale transaction has been approved by 75 % of ownership. 

The broker found a buyer ( namely, XXXX ) who is willing to pay a premium gross purchase price of {$390000.00} for all XXXX units in XXXX XXXX in a bulk purchase transaction pursuant to Section 15 of the Illinois Condominium Property Act, with a portion of the purchase price allocated to each unit on the basis of each unit 's percentage ownership interest in the common elements. The proposed transaction with XXXX XXXX XXXX presents an especially attractive opportunity for my unit. The price that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is prepared to pay for my unit ( and the other XXXX units in XXXX XXXX ) is at least 20 % higher than the price paid for any XXXX XXXX unit in many years. Moreover, the bulk sale structure involves significantly lower brokerage commissions. 

The proposed transaction with XXXX was recently approved by over 80 % of XXXX XXXX 's owners, so Illinois law requires that I and every other XXXX XXXX owner deliver clear title to our units to XXXX at closing, which is currently scheduled to occur on XXXX XXXX, 2016. 

In the case of my unit, the good news is that my unit 's 5.11 % share of the net proceeds of sale will generate approximately {$200000.00} -- all of which will be paid directly to you -- which is substantially more than what could possibly have been generated in a conventional private sale of my unit. However, the bad news is that approximately {$210000.00} will not be enough to fully pay off my mortgage with you, even though I will not be receiving any money from the sale of my unit. 

The Illinois Condominium Property Act contemplates that all lenders release their liens upon payment of 100 % of the net proceeds of sale in a Section 15 transaction, even if the net proceeds of sale are not sufficient to pay off the entire mortgage debt. Therefore, I am notifying you of your obligation to provide a mortgage payoff letter and release of your mortgage lien for my unit 's share of the net proceeds of sale, so my unit can be sold as part of the Section 15 bulk sale of all XXXX XXXX units on XXXX XXXX, 2016. 
The lender has refused to release the mortgage and they continue to add on late fees and other fees every month. I believe they are doing this to increase the amount of deficiency that I will owe. My question is do I have any recourse in regards to them not releasing the mortgage. The mortgage company HSBC 's lawyer advised them to settle and they still refuse. This is a clear violation of The Illinois Condominium Act. I would like to file a complaint and to pursue legal action. Can you please advise me on my options? Thanks!"

This check was an attempt to rollover the funds into a new HSA account since they have failed to provide services to me. 
At a minimum, I would call their failure to disburse my money a lack of good faith.

The activity happened at an ATM, which is fully equipped with cameras. Upon learning of the incident, I immediately filed a police report with the XXXX police department and submitted a copy to Bank of America. Now even after submitting a copy of the police report and being told that the person on the camera was not me, I was told by the bank that the only way the fraud could occur was for someone to have access to my pin number, which was in a sleeve with my card, as this was a new account. I was also told that since I did not secure my pin number, that I was considered an accessory, and was permanently band from Bank of America, not only did they band me from their facilities, they also entered my name on a fraud report, which denies me the right to utilize any other bank."
79346,Consumer Loan,"I had a car loan with consumer portfolio services I got behind on the payments and talked to them about it. They told me that they would work with me and I could defer 1 payment so we did that I thought, they never deferred the payment. I thought it was done.

I think they should replace my things and if they are gone compensate me for my belongings."

In speaking with XXXX several times, they tell me that there was a mistake on their end in sending my loan for collection but it has been over a month and they still have not addressed the issue although they claim they continue to work the issue in their Research department. However, I continue to get calls from ClearSpring demanding payment even though I have sent an e-mail to ClearSpring explaining the situation."
411229,Mortgage,"I started a loan process with Movement Mortgage in XXXX, South Carolina. The Loan officer 's name is XXXX XXXX. I have decided not to pursue a loan with Movement Mortgage due to XXXX 's unprofessional-ism and predatory practices of charging me at least double the rate of services in the mortgage lending industry. I have simply asked for the fee back that I paid for an "" appraisal '' the fee charged was {$650.00} which was my first indicator that XXXX was trying to rip me off. She then preceded to try to charge me {$890.00} in non-existent Administrative fees. I am choosing to use another loan officer and company at this point. I asked XXXX for my money back, she has refused to refund my {$650.00} back and told me to stop texting her phone. She then rudely said that I had the "" audacity '' to ask her to come to my work for my closing. I asked her to come to my work due to me just starting a new job a week ago and not able to get off to go to closing. After that insult, I have decided to pursue other mortgage lending options and would like a refund of the {$650.00} fee that I paid."
591817,Mortgage,"I contacted QuickenLoans about a possible VA mortgage online. I received a callback from representative XXXX XXXX about a possible mortgage. Under false pretenses, and against my verbal reservations, I allowed him to run a hard credit inquiry for my credit score, knowing that it could negatively impact my score. I had already informed him that I had recently inquired on my credit scores from the "" top XXXX '' ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) within the last XXXX days, and he assured me that the scores were fine, but Quicken needed to verify. He came back and told me that the scores were XXXX points less than the report I had received from the reporting agencies listed above, and then proceeded to explain to me that the scores were "" weighted '' for a mortgage. Nothing in the reporting I received from the agencies themselves indicated that there was a different score for mortgages than the score that was reported to me. I feel that I was coereced into allowing this company to get a hard credit inquiry, damaging my credit, when the representative did or should have known that my "" weighted '' credit score would not have been sufficient for a loan from Quicken."
239125,Credit card,"I called Wells Fargo to inquire if I could reduce my current personal credit card rate. I was told by the agent that "" they would transfer money into my personal checking account at 4.9 %, plus a fee '' When I asked for clarification, he had no clue what he was talking about. I KNOW what he was talking about - a Balance Transfer with a fee. He could not explain it, provide disclosures, provide details, etc. I immediately asked for his supervisor. "" XXXX '' got on the line after XXXX min to tell me that "" I was not understanding his associates words ''. HA. I totally understood ; his phone rep did not. I have worked in the credit card industry. It was misleading, uninformed, bogus, totally outside of standard practices."
632893,Debt collection,"I was contacted on Saturday about a loan I supposedly took out in 2011 from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX if I paid {$590.00} that day, the issue would be resolved even though I owed {$790.00}. When asked the original amount of the loan, XXXX could not give an answer - just advised somewhere between $ XXXX {$500.00}. When doing research on this Rosen Management, come to find out they have multiple complaints filed against them. A phone number for XXXX XXXX XXXX was found and called. They knew nothing about a loan, yet tried to sell me Protein Muscle Builder for body builders? I was then contacted today by a local number telling me legal action was going be taken if I did not pay my debts - basically calling me a deadbeat. When asked to send me the validation of debt paperwork, along with how to dispute this fraudulent activity, the gentleman declined. Per state of Wisconsin law, I have the right to request this information and it has to be sent within 5 days. Instead I was advised that my employment information had been verified and I can be expecting my wages to be garnished before being hung up on. This is not a legitimate company, and according to my attorney I have the right to request the above paperwork. Complaints have also been filed with the Federal Consumer Protection agency, along with the Consumer Finance agency."
451922,Prepaid card,"The company netSpend has mailed me an unsolicited, unwanted personalized prepaid debit card, received today, XXXX XXXX, 2015. I have not ever asked for this card. It is unsettling receiving an unsolicited card with my name already personalized, and a sticker with phone number for me to call to activate it in my name. 

Calling the company requires interaction with an automated voice system and the only way to get to a person at all without getting kicked off the call is to select an option that is not for the reason I was calling. After several attempts to get to a live person, I pressed the number for "" If your card is lost, stolen, or you 've never received your card ... '' Even then, the system reported that they were experiencing a heavy call volume and gave me options to hang up, select a time for a callback, or have someone call me back as soon as possible. I reluctantly selected a call back, but have yet to hear from anyone. 

Because I am very concerned about my identity records, unwarranted liability, and financial vulnerability, this has taken my time and attention trying to reach the company to scold them for sending me this card and demanding that they remove my information from their system. This business practice must stop! 

I am filing this complaint for the financial and privacy reasons stated, but primarily because of the stress of receiving the card in the mail at all and feeling that I needed to do something about it right away, although it is wasting my time to do so. 

Thus far, the company has prevented me from complaining to them about their actions and I find that grossly unacceptable. Their computerized phone interaction is unfriendly and dismissive at best, not allowing me to accomplish what I called about at the number they publicize on their web site and on the back of the card they sent. 

There is very tiny print on what I got in the mail giving information about how to decline the card offer and/or opt-out of future mail offers from netSpend. It is tucked away and does not address the problem I am reporting. I should not have to ask not to receive such mail with a personalized card enclosed. Something like that should never have been sent. I should not even need to go to the trouble of shredding the card and filing a complaint about receiving it."
130068,Consumer Loan,"Upon GE capital being switched to Synchrony Bank, I have had nothing but problems. I am a very patient person but since I got this loan I have dealt with absolutely terrible customer service, wrong information given to me consistently but several employees, and after about the XXXX phone call no one can transfer me to a manager. My loan has been paid off in full and the bank still owes me a refund check that I 've been waiting for, for over a month. They will not give me a date of when they can send it ( 7-10 ) business days, and when it does n't show up after that time frame they have to put a stop pay ( another 7-10 business days ) and then they can send out which could take another two weeks. I still have not received a call back as promised or anything regarding my refund check. I 've asked several people to speak to a manager but apparently there is only XXXX manager who takes calls and she is always busy and does not return phone calls. I honestly feel like they are not going to send my check back at all and I am not sure what do to anymore. I would have NEVER acquired a loan from them if I knew it was going to be anything like this. Do not do business with these people!"

This should n't have ever got reported to my credit. I agreed to pay cancel fee the manger needs to man up and call me or talk face to face. I 'm not the only XXXX in this situation. And it 's sad a manager ca n't call a member personal and talk on XXXX and solve the issue. No wonder why they had to find new Owner 's. Now the new ownersowners claim its nothing to do with them it was XXXX their time to take it up with collectors that they would agree to take it off my credit but they did n't know how to go about doing it. Do I need to get a attorney to help me get this removed??????

I made XXXX on-time payments and they still appear as late on my credit report.The agreement states they had to rescind the foreclosure and it still appears as a foreclose. For the past 6 weeks I have been trying to get XXXX to resolve it and I keep getting the run around I have documented that the payments were on time.If they had not been made the case could have been thrown out, I just want it reported accurately. They had 7 months to update the credit accurately and they have not updated anything. The court ruled they would receive my payments at settlement and they received the payments XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX now need to report it accurately as well as remove the foreclose. Every time I call I get a different story they told me the agreement does n't state they have to do credit repair but should n't they have to be accurate for a change? They are still looking into it! I was told I would get a call back yesterday, I did not when I called they said the person was out unexpectedly. It is always some reason. I just called again and got nowhere! 

I have attached the emails between the attorneys discussing this issue before the agreement was approved by the court and a few of my my payment receipts from the court. We signed the agreement XX/XX/XXXX, they got there money the same day and then it took 5 months to complete there side of the agreement. XXXX is an awful company!!"

131693,Mortgage,"I signed disclosures and locked in a 60 day rate with Bank of the West on XX/XX/2017. I received a revised loan estimate on XX/XX/2017 saying "" pricing changes upon underwriter review - non QM loan '' which added {$3800.00} or .5 % discount points to our loan. However, the sales price has been the same since I opened escrow on XX/XX/2017. Prior to this incident, I kept receiving disclosures in the mail with high discount points which did n't match the advertised rates for the day. I also wondered why other banks were able to do edisclosures but this bank was the only one that sent disclosures in the mail. When I raised the issue with my loan officer XXXX, he said the rates were off in their system and that he had no idea what was going on. I was confused as to how the rates our loan officer was able to lock were higher and had much higher discount points than what was published on Bank of the West 's website and on the Bank of the West rate watch daily emails. I told him I am adamant about not paying any discount points. I asked that he send a screenshot before locking in our rate. On XX/XX/2017 that 's when I locked in our 3.375 % XX/XX/XXXX ARM rate with XXXX discount points and a {$790.00} admin fee. Also, their appraisals are {$850.00} dollars which is $ XXXX {$400.00} higher than most banks. The loan processor XXXX sent an email on XX/XX/2017 saying that my loan was approved by the underwriter and that I would get the approval in the mail. Instead, I received a revised disclosure with {$3800.00} in fees for discount points."

I originally received notice of this with the name and number of a mortgage specialist to assist me with this process. I called and left numerous unanswered messages. I spoke to various representatives by calling Wells Fargo 's 800 number and nobody could help or get my situation straightened out. I finally made payments over the phone with a representative named XXXX who assured me my account would go back to the previous mortgage payment. Instead, as predicted because I have had similar issues with Wells Fargo in the the past, my account shows late payments. I have made each monthly payment timely, but my account has not been corrected yet and my escrow payment went toward principle. My account has been incorrect for XXXX months. I was told it would be fixed by the beginning of XXXX. This is showing poorly on my credit. My account now shows that my XXXX payment is delinquent, which it is not. I want this remedied immediately!

At that time she had agreed to pay the mortgage payments. Sometime after that the home was repossessed. I learned of this in XXXX XXXX I believe. Each year since I have tried contacting them to determine what the home sold for and if they were going to issue a XXXX to the IRS. Phone calls have not resulted in anything other than them telling me they have time to decide what they are going to do. They will not even tell me what the home sold for. I have since learned the home was re-titled XX/XX/XXXX to a business or leasing company. Currently they are reporting I owe {$75000.00} to all XXXX credit bureaus. This amount does not reflect properly even if the home was sold for {$1.00} I have recently obtained court documents that show they "" served '' me via a 3rd party. The server states they asked if I was an XXXX XXXX Service Member of The U.S or New York and received a negative reply. I am in fact currently on XXXX XXXX in New York and was at the that time as well. Country Place WAS aware of this as I had sent my orders and a copy of the NYS Patriot Plan.

I just need to know how much is pending and if or when they will issue a XXXX to which I would need to pay income tax on. This situation is now causing issues with my security clearance.

But when I closed my account Citibank charged me {$380.00}. Citi charged me for a new membership at just the time when I was canceling the card, which they informed me automatically cancels the membership. They charged {$110.00} for a XXXX membership with Citibank. Citibank has had my {$110.00} now for over a month.

668709,Debt collection,"I got XXXX in approximately XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX for the home of my elderly mother and XXXX sister. It was a two year contract. My mother died the following XX/XX/XXXX. My sister had to go to a XXXX the following XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX and asked if I could therefore be released from the contract. They said that since it was in my name ( I did not live at the house ) that I had to honor the contract, even though no one was living there. I honored the contract and paid monthly until it was finished. Before it was up, I called to cancel it. I was told I had a {$0.00} balance and that they would send a shipping box to me so I could return the box ( receiver, whatever it 's called ). I never received the box and called back. They had sent it to the wrong address -- one I had never heard of. Then they sent it to the proper address and the box was shipped to them. I later received a bill for {$16.00}. I called and talked to several people and said I did not owe it and thought the matter was settled. Then I received a COLLECTIONS notice from Stellar Recovery, Inc. I wrote on the statement in black magic marker that I did not owe XXXX. I never heard from Stellar Recovery again and assumed the matter was closed ... .I recently looked at a copy of my XXXX credit report, as my credit score had plummeted from nearly XXXX to XXXX. I see on the report that Stellar Recovery reported me for owing XXXX {$16.00} ( with a notation that it was originally {$17.00}? I never heard of the {$17.00}! ). I want this charge to be completely removed from my report, and I want Stellar and XXXX investigated. It would be very nice if I could get a refund for the last year, after my mother died and my sister went to the XXXX, but that is n't my main complaint ; I want the {$16.00} TOTALLY removed from all credit files ... I realize that many dishonest people take advantage of utility, cable and phone companies, but I was being honest and attempting to do everything correctly. I see now that I should have contacted you concerning XXXX refusing to release me from the contract after the death and move to the XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. And Stellar did NOT contact me in any form or fashion after I sent the dispute to them saying I did not owe the money. If you can not get this off of my credit file, I would like to know what legal resources are available to me to sue them. I am NOT going to live with destroying my credit for the next six+ years. I would probably have paid the {$16.00} they said I owed if I had known the matter had not been corrected and it was going to go against me. All of phone/cable/satellite companies apear to take advantage of those who try to be honest, as I previously had a battle with XXXX continuing to charge me after I had cancelled my service and have recently had to battle XXXX over charging me for internet service for five months after I moved and it was cancelled when I moved out-of-state ( resulting in having to spend four hours on the phone, speaking to 15 different people ).

He stated I am not sure about all of that but would you like to start making your payment today and we can set up XXXX months as your original schedule and we will report paid as agreed and when the accounts are paid in full it will be reported as satisfied not settled and stated he would send me a balance statement for my record and the agreement we discussed. 
Meantime I requested all XXXX credit reports from the XXXX credit reporting bureaus. To my surprise XXXX accounts appeared as a Charge Off and not 120 days late but 180 days late. I immediately contacted FIA Card services and wanted an explanation. The representative asked if I was ready to set up my next six month of payments I said no not until my accounts are reported paid as agreed and reverse the Charge Off she stated only a manger can do this so I requested to speak to a manager but XXXX XXXX XXXX, Account Specialist stated that this was strange how my accounts have disappeared for almost a year and no data being reported. Her theory was she recalled they had a system upgrade and some accounts did get lost during the system changed out might explained why XXXX XXXX stated they were here and never left recovery I spoke with XXXX representatives and XXXX managers. My accounts are still with FIA Card services and payments are being made the Bank of America balance owed are around {$900.00} and XXXX {$1200.00}. I have been paying as agreed but the account managers are telling me that they can not change the credit reporting from "" Charge Off '' this action has caused a huge drop in my FICO score! They lost my accounts for a year and I was unsuccessful finding out where the accounts went never contacted by a collection agency? The accounts still remain with Bank of America.

I called and ask about a refund and was told that I would receive a check.

776854,Bank account or service,"I was cheated by BB & T and the BBB could not handle the case and I am asking your help. 
My XXXX savings account was from XXXX opened in 1996. The bank was taken over by BB & T. I decided to let go of my high pay job and went to School. I wanted to close my savings account and I had plenty of Money in the checking account. The teller told me not to close it because if I had sufficient fund in the checking account there will not be any fees. I did not have that in writing, because I was banking with BB & T for many years. After XXXX months I found out that there is a monthly service charge of {$7.00} on a dormant account. I questioned the charges and they refuse to refund the money. When I went to close the account, they asked me to bring lots of ID to reactivate the account in person. Later I got a mail notice saying my account is active and please call to deactivate the account. I asked the manager saying if I was dead, would the money be depleted through service charges without letting my relatives know about the account and she said yes. She could not find any means to refund the money. I contacted XXXX, and their complain office for BB & T is in North Carolina, the same office of the BB & T head quarters. They did not intervene on my case, but acted as a medium for communication. When I tried to contact XXXX by writing I did not get any response. So please help. I have all documents and proofs. BB & T only refunded XXXX of the service charges and refused to refund the other half. 
Few things : If a customer dies, there is no written notice to the client or relatives regarding the balance in the bank. 
Second, The meaning of "" BANK '' for savings is no longer applicable in BB & T because their business practices does not allow written notification regarding dormant accounts. 
Third the term "" dormant '' is unfairly XXXX way. I can not as an account holder withdraw the money without ID, but the bank can enjoy deducting money till it is empty. When I went to activate it. they need all the ID and they wanted me in person. 
Please help."

45899,Mortgage,"I have been going back and forth with Bank Of America trying to get a modification on my loan they purchased from another bank. 
I am not going to provide too much of my personal information due to he fact that I am uncertain of the security of this site. I have been telling Bank of America that my interest rate is 8 % which is way too high. I have had my mortgage for about 10 years and only {$300.00} is going to the principle of the mortgage to pay it off. I paid over {$25000.00} in interest alone to BanK of America. If this bank received bailout money from the government why is it so hard for them to work with homeowners. I have been receiving letters from them asking me to just have a shot sale and move. I have never been late on my mortgage in all the nine years I have had this house. It 's only recent that I have been have trouble with paying the mortgage and I would n't be asking for help if I did n't need it. It really is starting to cause health issues when dealing with these representatives who work for Bank of America. They sound like robots as if they are reading from a script and they are repeating themselves. Example : I made a late payment, but was still trying to get approved for the modification. The representative made a statement to me, "" Well, XXXX I see that your mortgage is current so there is no need to continue the process for the mortgage loan modification ''. I was puzzled and really got upset because she is suppose to be my relationship manager XXXX. She do n't really understand nor can she speak english. It 's almost like she is really not helpful with the fact that we have a language misunderstanding. She does n't work in my best interest. I have done through this for over a year and half and recent got denied yet again. I need help and hope that their is something that can be done to lower my interest rate and mortgage payment. I barely can afford to feed my family because of the fact that we are struggling."

However RISE WILL NOT UPDATE MY PAYMENT OR DELETE THE CHARGE OFF WHICH WAS DONE AFTER PAYMENT WAS MADE."
135649,Bank account or service,"I opened a new account XX/XX/2016 on a Saturday with Bank of America. The account representative used misinformation to fraudulently and deceptively sale me the idea of opening the account that day. At the time of the {$10000.00} deposit I inquired about the availability of the funds then asked if there would be ANY funds made available. She told me not to worry because {$200.00} would be made available to me that same day after I mentioned that I needed to pay a credit card bill and provide an earnest down payment to a personal seller of a vehicle that I desired to purchase. The arrangement for a small cash payment would be a security deposit while the remainder of the funds cleared. I told the account representative who opened the account that I would just open the account at XXXX XXXX if there would be an issue with providing at least {$200.00} that same day. She again told me not to worry then escorted me to the teller to complete the processing activation of the temporary debit card. The teller then restated that the {$200.00} would be made available the same day on XXXX XXXX that Saturday. To my shocking surprise, I was not able to make a withdrawal until the following Tuesday XXXX XXXX. Unacceptable. I doubt Bank of America makes it a point to train employees to blatantly lie in order to open new accounts with {$10000.00} check deposits. 

I suffered an XXXX due to the fraudulent and deceptive unfair trade practice. I have a XXXX of XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX. My symptoms were aggravated as a result of the misinformation causing personal injury."

715542,Debt collection,I have been paying on a debt that Portfolio Recovery said that I owed I have asked for confirmation of the debt. I have been paying for 8 months and they have still not provided me with proof of the debt. I know XXXX credit card only had a credit limit of XXXX and by the time I finish paying for the 12 months I will have paid more. I live on a limited income and this month it will be hard to pay and they threaten to make me pay more. They are also trying to collect on a XXXX card which they again have not sent proof. I have been holding up to my agreement and they have not held up their part by sending proof. They have only harassed me and threaten legal action. XXXX credit card is for XXXX which I have been paying last 8 months and only had a credit limit of XXXX. The other card is a XXXX XXXX which I have been paying {$150.00} a month for by the time I am done will be almost {$2000.00}. Then they are saying there is another XXXX XXXX credit card which they are saying is around {$3000.00} I never had a card with that big of a limit. None of these cards have they sent me any proof of what is owed and paying this is becoming financially difficult and I believe I should have proof.
267519,Consumer Loan,"I am a XXXX on a fixed income. I have just enough income each month to pay my bills and to feed and provide shelter for me. If I have extra expenses in one month, it puts me behind financially and this is what happened in this situation..I have a loan with Honda Financial. 
I have paid {$380.00} a month, without interruption, to Honda since XXXX, until a month or so ago, when it changed to {$400.00}, using the extra {$17.00} to pay off late fees that had accrued and for which your agency helped me to finally stop accruing. All because Honda would not change my payment date. 
In early XXXX XXXX, I had some extraordinarily large bills to pay. Car registration, and other car repairs that had to be done i.e. replace an old battery, as well as one-time medical bills.I tried to borrow money but I was not able to do do that. In any event if I borrow money it makes things worse, because I go further into a financial hole and can not pay it back.So now I owe {$400.00} for XXXX XXXX which I just do not have the money to pay. I just made a {$400.00} payment to Honda, which is all I could send, and it was applied to XXXX XXXX. Now, I am getting calls twice a day about the XXXX payment. I also received a very disturbing, threatening letter from a XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX ) XXXX of Honda telling me that Honda Financial will use every resource under the law to get that payment, including re-possessing my car. I have tried to remonstrate with Honda Financial, to have them understand that I am a responsible consumer who wants to pay her bills on time every month as I have done 5 years. I 've had a run of high expenses that have to be paid, I have not used the money for unnecessary frivolities.And yes, I yearn to be able to save money each month to cover emergencies such as I have just had, but I just do n't have the income to be able to do that. Can you please contact Honda and see if there can be a solution to this impasse between Honda Financial and me? I believe they think I 'm not terribly intelligent, and perhaps might be doing this on purpose. I 've had a run of bad luck, but now I would like to continue paying my monthly payment every month for the approximately 15 months I have left to pay off the loan. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX."
109755,Mortgage,"Do want to thank the CFPB for providing a forum to address Mortgage fraud. In my case JPMorgan Chase and XXXX XXXX as the CEO. JPMorgan Chase was and is the judge and jury in this case of downright fraud. They gave me a verbal mortgage ( their written word ) and decided after the first payment that they would no longer accept anymore payments. Dealing with over XXXX of their representatives - who were working under the direction of JP Morgan Chase with an incentive to foreclose on homes ( still waiting for XXXX XXXX to confirm ). No amount of forms filled out and sent by every conceivable method would ever arrive intact for this company. The stress, the torture that I went through is unbelievable. The answer was always the same - your file is empty, nothing in the file - who gave you the mortgage, who told you your home is in foreclosure, we have no idea what you are talking about. In the meantime bills that I was not allowed to pay was being wracked up by this dishonest institution. They finally had to agree recently that the claim of sending XXXX inspectors to our home was a mistake. I never saw one. No one ever rang the doorbell. Absolutely dishonest financial institution and as they say 'A fish stinks from the head down '. Now I am constantly on a 'merry-go-round '' of papers with them. Each week I can guarantee that they will send another form telling me that they are "" Researching '' and will get back to me. Researching what. You had nothing in the file to begin with, unless you are trying to find ways to lie. What is there to research after all this time and fooling the CFPB about 'partial response '. A morass of corruption if ever I see one. At this time, I am taking my frustrations to the next level..Let me and XXXX XXXX take our case to the American Consumer. Let them continue with the useless 'researching and asking for extension ' routine. So thank you CFPB for providing a platform, however this is going nowhere and JPMorgan Chase has this figured out. In every instance of corporations and countries having a XXXX moment ' it is usually done by one individual. Well, I will make sure that 'Too Big to Fail '' JPMorgan Chase has its day of reckoning and hope to one day see the CEO XXXX XXXX doing the 'perp walk '. It is about time. There are many politicians out there in this competitive election year who would definitely like to put a face to the mortgage mess created by dishonest institutions like JPMorgan Chase while taking government bailout. Thanks again to CFPB but dishonest institutions like JPMorgan Chase feel secure in knowledge that they can fool you and everyone with useless extensions."

5. Ocwen sent the letter from themselves to themselves therefore never being delivered to me. I have enclosed a copy of the letter as well as the tracking results I received from my local post office.

442951,Credit card,"Approximately 3 years ago, I opened a Sears Citi MasterCard at the urging of a store clerk but the card was closed about a year later ( over 2 years ago ). After the cIosure, I spoke with a Sears customer service representative who encouraged me to sign up for auto-pay to pay off the balance. I was told that the payments would go to the balance until it was paid off. Knowing that I had a substantial balance on the card, I just kept making the payments for over two years. This XX/XX/XXXX I decided to call the company on XX/XX/2017 and inquire about my balance because I had no online access to look at the balance. To my shock, I was told that the balance had not changed one bit! I was told that all the payments which totaled thousands of dollars had gone to paying the interest and XXXX, which was NEVER disclosed to me. Apparently, every month, XXXX was getting part of the payment made. When I began disputing this, the Sears rep removed XXXX and transferred me to an XXXX rep. I was then told that they would need 30 days to investigate. Thirty days passed so I called back and was told that they would need another 30 days. I wrote a letter to XXXX on XX/XX/2017 because I was told that there was no other way to reach anyone in that department and that they make the decisions. I have yet to receive any response from either XXXX or Sears. Sears has taken no responsibility and XXXX obviously does not care. Sears continues to force me to make payments for a balance that should have been paid off or close to being paid off and tell me that if I do n't make the payments, my credit would show that I am behind. As the only one working in my family, I can not afford to spend another couple of thousand dollars paying on this card. Sears and XXXX are literally taking food out of the mouths of my family members and they do n't care!"

83540,Payday loan,"Received a loan from Mobiloans. They were deceitful in their monthly payment schedule. They have been withdrawing more money from my checking account than I agreed to. Yet when I look at the payment history it does n't reflect the entire payment. Their practices are extremely deceitful and the "" language '' is written in a way that seems legitimate, understandable and upfront. However, they 've never provided a truth in lending disclosure as promised when I applied and I do not have one in "" my account information. '' What they offered when I applied is NOT what is being followed. I 've contacted them and they are NOT willing to assist.

89968,Bank account or service,"Hi, I opened a checking & savings account at "" Spark Business Bank Account online '' ( a new service from Capital One Bank, it 's a business account that can be opened online, but the downside is you can not deposit cash or withdraw cash from this account, you can only withdraw cash from ATM XXXX for my newly formed corporation "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and I began using the account and everything was good. One day I log in to my account, I wanted to transfer funds from my checking account to the savings account, because even though at the time I opened the account I opened a checking and saving, they only allowed XXXX XXXX checks to the checking account, so after it posts I transfer it to the savings account to accrue interest. So back to three weeks ago I logged into to transfer money from my checking to saving, and it came up a error message that I need to call in. At first the representative asked me XXXX questions to make sure I 'm not using someone else 's identity, and even though they knew I was n't and I was fully verified, they figured that now that my account has approx. {$20000.00} it 's the perfect time to put a hold in order to make me miserable, and going through such aggravations that I was very close to a XXXX XXXX. The rep tells me "" We decided to close your account since the {$10000.00} check you deposited was not good '' First I asked for an explanation what not good means, and I was not given XXXX, all she said is "" I also does n't know but this is what I see in the notes, and there 's nothing more I can do for you!! "". So I 'm basically now in a position where Capital One Bank has close to {$20000.00} of my money, and I 'm not being given a reason why, and they tell me they do n't have an answer for me what 's to be done next. The next day I call again, and I guess a representative with a little more feeling for another Human Being felt the pain I 'm going through, and she told me the reason is ( from what she can see in the notes ) is that Capital One has a feeling the XXXX check was either stolen or will be returned. I instantly called the company that issued me the check and explained everything I 'm going through, and unlike Capital One Bank that seek to make your life miserable, provided me with a copy of the check that it was cleared, along with a copy from his bank statements showing that the check was out. And I myself saw in back on the check that Capital One accepted the check and they have the funds. I instantly emailed it to Capital One, but as expected no response. So I called again for the next week every day several time, every time I was told I 'm being transferred to the fraud department, and after waiting 20 minutes I was told "" OH SORRY THEY TRANSFERRED YOU TO THE WRONG FRAUD DEPARTMENT '' and I was further transferred to a voice mail, I left XXXX of messages begging for a call back and offered everything in the world. I asked specifically XXXX times if I can go into a Branch, and not even XXXX phone call ws returned!!!! 

Bottom line, I opened an account, once I had close to {$20000.00} Capital One decided "" now is a good time to hold the funds, so we might pass the stress test '' and I was accused of not being XXXX XXXX, I was accused of depositing a stolen check, I was not given the opportunity to prove myself, and not even to prove myself in persona. 

I therefore ask CFPB to help me with this, so I should n't have to spend way ore on a lawyer to take Criminal Action against them, because if I do n't do it, then there 'll be thousands of people with money stuck in these accounts. 

Thanks XXXXXXXXXXXX"

Once I arrived at the dealership and consulted with XXXX XXXX, she informed me that not only did I not qualify for the XXXX percent interest rate but I also had the option of only XXXX car at a higher interest rate, around five percent. I thought this was odd because my credit score was XXXX at the time but with her pushy tactics, I felt forced into the deal. She told me that I did not qualify for the XXXX percent rate but there was another program I qualified for that included higher rates. Last year, I went to another dealership, Honda of XXXX in Ohio, to trade my car in and I was told about restrictions against a trade-in deal. I found out that the Honda of XXXX dealership overcharged me for the car and I was responsible for excess charges. The salesman at the Honda of XXXX also informed me that Honda of XXXX was known for schemes such as the one I am now entangled in. With the recent lawsuit filed against Honda concerning discrimination, my situation aligns with the trouble I have been and still am experiencing.

289499,Mortgage,"After literally years of trying to get Bank of America to send documentation as to why and how I am bound to their terms, I received an interesting document from Seterus whom Bank of America turned my loan over to. Now to be very clear, Bank of America did not provide this document to me even though I have been asking for it for years but here 's the most interesting part, it is a 'Assignment of Mortgage ' document dated XXXX/XXXX/2016. I hope everyone sees the issue here, they have for years not only been harassing me and collecting money and everything else, but very clearly they had not done what was proper and there 's still parts to it that are not proper but I still have n't put the pieces together with this. The fact is that Bank of America has grossly mis-handled my loan and I have another document that XXXX has provided which I believe to be forgery but first, I would like an explanation from Bank of America on this document and that explanation should include why BoA did not file this previously and also why was I not provided a copy from BoA??? One very notable part of this is that my loan was transferred to Countrywide so I still do not believe that this document is valid or relevant in any way. Another thing is that this document was never recorded which perhaps is a clear indication BoA knows there is a problem with this document. One more addition is that the 'note ' that XXXX sent does not match the original mortgage note that was recorded for the loan so again, there is A LOT of suspect material at this point!"
541223,Credit reporting,"This complaint is against Equifax for illegally reinserting negative information on my credit report. 

A couple of months ago, I started disputing some inaccurate pieces of information that were showing up on my Equifax file. One of these small details was related to a wrong reporting date on a XXXX credit card account that I felt should have been updated. 

The account number for the account is : XXXX Until recently, this account was reporting with a XXXX balance due on my credit report. After Equifax received my disputes, they started reporting a negative balance of {$1400.00} on my credit for no reason at all! For years, this account had been reporting as paid and settled with Equifax. 

Equifax has no right or reasoning to suddenly place a large balance on one of my settled accounts without any explanation. 

To facilitate the CFPB 's investigation, I am including screenshots from XXXX XX/XX/2016 credit reports that showed Equifax was reporting a "" XXXX '' balance on my XXXX account. I am also including a screenshot from a recent report which shows how Equifax has suddenly inserted the {$1400.00} balance. As you can see, a large balance was placed on my credit from one report to the next. This is wrong. 

I called XXXX to see if maybe the mistake was made by them but when I called, the supervisor said the debt was so old they do n't have any information on it! This is proof that there is no balance due on the account!"

I was able to get my Bank which is XXXX XXXX XXXX to pull my payment history for AES but we were n't able to pull payment history for the other name ( before AES ) because XXXX XXXX XXXX can only go back as far as XXXX ( I have attached these payments ). I have been paying on it since XXXX and the loan never moved. I have never been late on a payment, so technically the loan should be paid in full by now. I did n't stop paying on the loan until I filed for bankruptcy. The National Collegiate Student Loan never appeared for the bankruptcy hearing to dispute discharging the loan. Now all of sudden my credit is being hit and I 'm sent to the collection agency for full payment of the loan. I tried in the past working something out with them but they would n't work with me they said I did n't have any deferments. I had twins which lead to me having to file bankruptcy because I was doing it all by myself. I ca n't afford this loan and I feel like they have and are still trying to rip me off. After my bankruptcy the federal government student loan worked out an affordable plan with me and has also forgiven a large portion of my student loan and they have been very helpful. However, the private student loan that is n't federally backed is very difficult and is trying to make me pay a loan for the rest of my life that has technically already been paid off."

The problem I see is that for verification purposes, they ask ton of questions but for the people who used the card more than once, they ask no question. They should improve the card security questions to avoid fraud over and over. Then you call to request a dispute, and they want you to give them specific information from last statement with amount and date. I do n't even print statements nowadays to save paper, and the Call Center wants you to tell them by the cent."
290198,Mortgage,"I refinanced my mortgage with BB & T in XXXX. Previously my mortgage was held by XXXX XXXX XXXX. Yearly, XXXX XXXX XXXX would send a threatening letter telling me that I had to increase my flood insurance to match the coverage of my homeowners/windstorm insurance. Initially, I did increase it, but a class action filed against XXXX XXXX XXXX resulted in the bank changing its practices. In subsequent years after the suit, XXXX XXXX XXXX would send me a waiver to acknowledge the discrepancy, which I would sign and return. 

I have lived in my home since XXXX, XXXX : 44 years, 4 months and I have NEVER filed a flood claim. I survived XXXX and other catastrophic storms. Not once have I had damage to my home due to rising water flooding. This is the only type of flooding covered by the Florida flood insurance policies. I live in a flood zone, but my home is on a ridge in that zone. In XXXX, I paid for an elevation certificate to prove my elevation. Due to this certificate, my flood insurance dropped drastically from over {$1000.00} to somewhere around {$300.00}, yearly. The point of this explanation is the only way I will have rising water flooding is in the event of massive storm surge due to a hurricane. In which case I would file claims with both my homeowners/windstorm and the flood insurances. This year there is almost XXXX of insurance coverage to protect my home. ( {$190000.00} of homeowners /windstorm coverage and the proposed {$170000.00} of flood insurance coverage ) The current balance on my mortgage is {$130000.00} Last week I received a letter from BB & T stating that my flood insurance does not match my home owners/windstorm coverage and that if I do not increase the flood insurance, they will force place a policy in the amount {$21000.00}, at their expense ( the difference between the XXXX policy coverages ). I called BB & T XXXX XXXX, XXXX and requested to speak with a supervisor. The young lady I spoke with assured me she would be able to assist me with the issue, but after the above explanation, she said I would have to increase my flood insurance coverage or the force placement would go into effect. I asked to speak with a supervisor. She said the answer would be the same, I insisted, and she said a supervisor was not available, nor was a senior advisor and I would have to wait until XXXX XXXX for a return call. 

I did receive a phone call from XXXX XXXX ( I believe she is a senior advisor in the insurance department ) at BB & T at around XXXX XXXX. today, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I repeated the problem detailed above. She did say the requirement for the homeowners /wind storm insurance was that I only had to have enough insurance to cover the amount of the loan. If I wanted to decrease the amount of homeowners/windstorm insurance to equal the amount of flood insurance that would be acceptable, but the XXXX coverages did have to match. I still have not been able to speak with a supervisor. I asked to speak with someone higher up in the company that would be able to give me a waiver. She told me no one has the authority to give waivers as they do not give waivers. Another compromise XXXX XXXX XXXX suggested was that if I could get the flood insurance company to state, on the declaration page, that the {$170000.00} was the replacement cost of the home and to provide the elevation, BB & T would accept that documentation and they would not force place the additional flood insurance. Neither of these suggestions make sense to me. 

I will include the following : The letter from BB & T, my current declaration pages from both insurance policies, the elevation certificate, the proposed XXXX flood coverage, and the flood zone map showing my property. 

I am selecting the "" making payments '' category below but none of the categories really fit my issue."

How long do they have to return this money to my checking account? 
Should n't they be able to provide a complaint line to the consumer? 
If they hold my money do n't they make interest on it and should n't I receive that money? Where did I go wrong in using my VISA card?

181503,Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Below is my complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and is an example of why the American people are angry with the government and its agencies for not holding the Big Banks accountable ( one of the biggest is Wells Fargo ) in helping the American Homeowners get affordable mortgage modifications and stay in their homes. 
I am a XXXX, single, XXXX woman who works XXXX jobs and have been trying to get an affordable Mortgage modification from Wells Fargo while in Bankruptcy. 
I am a victim of Predatory lending. I was given a pick-a-payment loan in XXXX by XXXX XXXX who is now Wells Fargo. Before Wells Fargo took over from Wachovia who had my mortgage at that time, they told me that in order to qualify for the Help for Homeowners mortgage modification program I had to be in default of my loan. They advised me to stop making my payments and then I would qualify. So, I stopped making my payments to qualify. They also said because of my age and the fact that I was an unmarried single woman that women are considered a high risk. 
I filed for Bankruptcy in XXXX of XXXX. I filed a modification and had XXXX meditations with my attorney, Wells Fargo 's Attorney and an attorney who was a mediator for both parties. 
In the first mediation, for a new modification for a fixed mortgage of {$320.00} at 2 % and they said the new payment would be {$1000.00}. My attorney said I was paying that to the trustee and there would be no problem. My attorney questioned their Good Faith estimate which they used to try to show how I did not qualify. He asked what the {$7000.00} fee for forced place home owner 's insurance and also the incorrect amount of my salary by not including my bonuses from both companies I work for. Their attorney agreed that if this was reduced and the bonuses where included this would help in me being approved. 
The mediator said that she would waive her fee for the next meeting to get this resolved for all parties. Wells Fargo attorney told everyone that once I submitted proof of new Home owner 's insurance and a Letter of Explanation of my bonuses, that my figures were good and I would have no problems qualifying and getting approved for the modification. We all agreed to meet again after they received the paperwork. 
That same day, I sent my attorney a new Homeowners policy for XXXX and more pay-stubs the next day along with a Letter of Explanation regarding the bonuses I receive from both companies I work for. My attorney submitted the paperwork to Wells Fargo the next day. 
Wells Fargo refused to meet with us again to review everything, and instead sent a denial letter for the modification. 
So, I filed all over again several times and finally got approved ; I spoke with XXXX XXXX my Wells Fargo loan specialist who told me I was approved for {$290000.00} modification at 2 % fixed mortgage with a payment of {$1500.00}. I made my XXXX Trail payments I was required to make and after the third payment they sent the new modification paperwork. 
However, the new mortgage modification I received the note went from {$290000.00} to {$640000.00}. The house only appraised at XXXX. 
How was I denied a {$320000.00} mortgage and now am approved for a {$640000.00} note? This is nothing more than predatory lending again! How can a XXXX, single, XXXX woman in bankruptcy, sign a Mortgage Note for more that the house is appraised for? What I want as an outcome is an affordable fixed mortgage based on what I was denied in the first mediation and even now at 2 % at the appraised value of the house which is {$290000.00}. 
This is exactly why XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX won! Because the American people are tired of the corruption of the government not doing anything and banks get away with it."

We called XX/XX/XXXX to notify them and they we very apologetic and cancelled the duplicated payment and offered to refund us the {$32.00}. We sent the necessary paper work to them that day.

Though they resolved the escrow issue and are now working to fix the recent payment processing errors Shellpoint treats its customers as guilty until proven innocent. The only way I seem to get results is to threaten reporting them to this agency. Well, I have had enough ... 
As a servicer should be able to process escrow payments to insurers without tripple paying them, and they should be able to properly process payments without double withdrawing the funds and then charging the consumer a NSF and it should not take hours and hours of the consumers time on the phone fixing their mistakes.

Additionally, it makes me think that they are doing this to all of their customers. I have never had a credit card that still charges interest after I have paid the balance in full and on time. 

I called Macy 's and was explained that because I had a previous balance from my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX statement of {$91.00}, in which I was charged interest of {$2.00} in the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX statement, I was charged interest of {$4.00} in my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX statement. Their explanation to this interest charge was based on a note indicated in their XXXX/XXXX/XXXX statement. It is a long, difficult to follow note that I would be happy to supply upon request. Regardless, I am not familiar with consumer credit rules ; however, as stated previously, I am concerned that a credit card company is charging interest after balances are paid in full and on time, as this is something that I have not experienced with other creditors. 

I did not become aware of this extra interest fee until my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX statement arrived and the balance was {$6.00}. When I called Macy 's they indicated that this amount would be credited back to me, and the new balance would be XXXX dollars. While this issue was resolved, I still feel that it is something that warrants additionally concerns since this is likely happening to thousands of consumers."

Only to be notified by Wells ' Fargo some months later that their escrow accounts had a shortage. And of course, Well 's Fargo promptly lend them a high interest rate monies to cover their escrow shortages. Several borrower 's went in to foreclosure ; because, they could not afford the new higher monthly payments. Some, other lucky borrowers were able to re-finance with another lender.

They do n't provide enough information to the borrower and did n't let me know the interest rate and I am just finding out that all my loans are private which I thought they were federal loans. This is becoming a XXXX for me and I am out of options. I am asking you to please look into my account. I will provide screenshots of how much I owe and the interest rate on the loans.

741995,Prepaid card,"I purchased a gift card on XXXX/XXXX/2015 in the amount of {$250.00}. I attempted to use the card in the evening on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and it was declined. I called the customer service number on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and a representative told me that the cashier must have activated the wrong gift card but that she could see the money. I was instructed to fax over some information ( front/back of card, activation receipt, name, phone number, email address, contact time preference ). I did this on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I called back on XXXX/XXXX/2015 to inquire on the status of the fax and was told that it would take 7-10 business days after the fax was received. I asked to escalate the issue and that group informed me that it was n't an activation issue. He said someone had tried to use the card twice in XXXX so when I purchased it in XXXX they decided to not activate it. So the company is holding onto my {$250.00} and giving me the runaround on how to get it back. I 've called them XXXX times ( with a hold time of no less than XXXX minutes ) and every time I receive a different set of instructions. I just called again and they said they were waiting on my fax. I stated that I had already faxed it in so they placed me on a brief hold. They then informed me that they had received my fax and were waiting on additional action from me. I would now need to fax in my address and that the voicemail left on XXXX/XXXX/2015 stated that. I replayed the voicemail to make sure I did n't miss anything. I have been unsuccessful at every attempt made. I feel this is fraudulent and misleading. If the company knows that an attempt has been made to use a gift card prior to it ever being sold, they should not be allowed to take the consumer 's money and have them scrambling trying to recover it. This company knowingly sold me a useless gift card with the knowledge that I would not be able to do anything with it."
167734,Mortgage,"On XXXX/XXXX/15 I went to pay My Nationstar Mortgage online and the bill had quadrupled. Nationstar has decided to quadrupled my mortgage and the previous statement that was sent to me in the mail in XXXX did not reflect this change. I had never escrowed my taxes before, but had been late the previous year, but was in a payment plan with XXXX XXXX on my property so I never thought I needed to worry about it. Nationstar was no collecting on the bill I was in a payment plan with and all future "" estimated '' tax bills. I was n't prepared. I called but the call center was closed so on XXXX I called immediately in the morning. A representative said that they would look into it and see what they could do. I told her that I always pay my mortgage on the last day of the month and that I did not want a ding on my credit. She assured me that this would not happen. They told that I should refinance and start the paperwork with them and that would stop any action. I sent in some paperwork, but then decided that I did not think that this was wise, and that I should look into selling the home. On XXXX, I received a revised bill, which I immediately paid, only reduced by a XXXX, and Nationstar reported the payment as late even though they told me that they were working on the bill and that they were changing it. This is a predatory practice, and they are wrong. I was never late with a payment, and struggled to pay the mortgage until I sold, and I did, every single month while raising my child as a single mother and they preyed on me. I owned my home and had stellar credit. I put the house up for sell, and now because of the late payment they put on my credit report for their misdirection, it could prevent me from buying again because of the drop in my credit score, which they wanted to happen so they could force me to finance with them, or do a homeowner hardship program, which I did not need. They also required me to pay my mortgage through the XXXX account when I had a problem with my checking account withdrawal through them for some reason and they monogram would not take payments over {$2500.00}, forcing the consumer to pay all kinds of money transfer fees on top of the payments, and XXXX will only transfer that amount daily, which also resulted in a late payment for XXXX day late in XXXX They also remove electronics documents from the customer logins that they may have sent you over time so that you can not see actions that they may have taken when you go back to look."

I believe during that time, they filed for a judgment. I had no letters or notification until the judgement was filed. This was not fair practices and I was so upset. I contacted an attorney and he said they could not collect since everything we had was joint and it would cost me thousands to get removed. How fair is that when and we have been cheated so badly.

This needs to be corrected as I am a victim of unfair business practices. According to XXXX back then the balance was all credited."

After making all on time payments to Ocwen during the payment plan, and making final cure payment to Ocwen, Ocwen still reflects the escrow shortage balance that should have been paid off XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted the trustee office which confirmed that all arrear payments had been made in full. Ocwen has not responded to my several requests for a detail accounting of my payment history since initially requesting this XX/XX/XXXX. The office of the Ombudsmen has sent me a letter each month telling me they are researching the matter, but has failed to do anything more. I just received a foreclosure prevention packet in the mail this week as well. Ocwen has since increased my mortgage payment by more than {$200.00} additional each month. I am unable to pay the bogus amounts that Ocwen is reflecting as they have added even more unexplained fees and charges to my account after the discharge with no explanation! I have sent a complaint to XXXX and the IL states attorney XXXX XXXX 's office, but have been unsuccessful thus far on getting anywhere with this case. I find it unreal that they were just sued for fraud and their unfair practices, and yet here they are again doing the very same thing. I would really appreciate your help in this matter."

619387,Consumer Loan,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I entered into a vehicle retail installment contract with Santander Consumer, the loan was for 72 months, at {$390.00} monthly. The loan was to mature XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my account was approved for the SCRA adjustment and my interest rate was adjusted to 6.00 % and my payment was decrease to {$300.00}. This agreement stayed in effect until XXXX XXXX, XXXX in which I had to recertify the adjustment. The application was approved on XX/XX/XXXX with an interest rate of 0.00 %. During the course of the loan I was granted four extensions ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ). With these XXXX extension being placed at the end of the loan my maturity date should have been adjusted on or about XX/XX/XXXX instead my maturity date is XX/XX/XXXX. 
I think the company did not properly adjust my loan balance when they approved my account under the Soldier Civil Relief Act for the 6.00 % interest and instead just decreased my payment leaving my balance total figured at the 15.99 % interest rate. I also do not think they adjusted my balance when they stated my account was at a 0.00 % interest rate either."

He must have realized afterwards of his mistake their was no message left. I called back spoke to a very pleasant representative named XXXX XXXX I immediately told her I received a call. She advised me it clearly is marked on my account DO NOT CALL. She did n't try to sugar coat it or make any excuses. She apologized for that being done. As she knows this was a clear violation of FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICE ACT. She asked me if I would like to speak to the representative handling my account. I said yes, he was unfortunately was n't available. So I opted to speak to his supervisor so he would speak to his rep as a coaching opportunity. The call was transferred to his supervisor XXXX. XXXX came on the phone his tone came across as if I was interrupting him from something more important. I began to explain that I was called when I should n't have been. Supervisor XXXX stated very un-professional and not never apologized for this mishap. He stated he would speak to his rep. Wow! Then he went on to discuss my account which there was n't any need to do so since I was just given a 2 month deferral. I told XXXX my XXXX payment is set to come out on XXXX/XXXX/16. XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payment was deferred. He starred he sees that. There was n't ANY REASON to go over it because I was calling in about your EMPLOYEE! XXXX tried to tell me with the deferral was approved but this will still effect my credit. I told him I know I got a XXXX day for XXXX, And I will have a XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX since my payments are due XX/XX/XXXX. I told him once the payment post my account will be current. XXXX tried to tell me my deferral wo n't be processed until XXXX/XXXX/16 even though my payment is set up to come out on XXXX/XXXX/16. I will get hit with ANOTHER XXXX credit marker on XXXX/XXXX/16 when my deferral will be processed???!?! How is that possible when I just got THIS MONTH XXXX day credit marker TODAY. He told me if I do n't care about my credit then that 's on me. First if all I had a PERFECT account for 20 months..I 'm sorry but my mother almost XXXX XXXX I had to fly back to XXXX. So things/life do happen. Everyone at Ally had been wonderful EXECPT XXXX. It scares me that he is giving out INCORRECT INFORMATION. Especially since Ally just paid out on their class action lawsuit.

I received the letter in XXXX. I called and was told to send all of my bank statements proving that I did indeed pay. I faxed all of my statements as requested and the XXXX payment was noted as well as the past 4 months payments. I was sent a letter requesting front and back of check to prove who indeed cashed it. The statement clearly states that the check was converted to an ACH payment and the front and back of check is not available! I called XXXX XXXX, my local bank, and the branch manager, XXXX XXXX, requested the front and back of check from XXXX XXXX who handles the account for Carrington.

63729,Bank account or service,"My father XXXX XXXX XXXX died on XXXX XXXX 2015. I have attached a death certificate. He died at XXXX years of age. My sister and I live in different locations ; we are not in XXXX New York. It was only going through his papers that we discovered that checks had been forged out of his checkbook by XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was a tenant of my father 's. Following that discovery, I went to visit XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX to discuss the forgery ; XXXX works at First Niagara Bank. XXXX asked me if a Forgery report had been filed, I said not to my knowledge. He called the Fraud Department of First Niagara and they said nothing could be done, given that a report had not been filed. My sister then found a copy of the filed report and we sent that on to XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Again, I emphasize that First Niagara Bank never indicated that report had been filed prior to my father 's death. 
XXXX XXXX later requested a copy of the Police Report which we did send to him on XXXX XXXX. XXXX asked me what the XXXX Police Department and DA had decided ; I shared that given his death, they had decided it would be impossible to prosecute but that is entirely separate and unrelated matter to the bank 's investigation. Numerous phone calls to XXXX were unreturned. Numerous emails were ignored. 
Finally, in late XXXX, First Niagara determined that they had no liability for the numerous bad checks that were cashed. In total XXXX forged checks were cashed. My father did not have on-line banking and discovered the fraud in XXXX. 
-I attach his Death Certificate-The Affidavit Filed by XXXX XXXX XXXX-The Police Report-The letter from First Niagara with the "" amount of time '' as a reason for not reimbursing. 
Frankly, I am disgusted that a XXXX Bank would not disclose the existence of an Affidavit at our meeting in XXXX. I am further disgusted that when all requests for information were met, and in the circumstance of a death, that First Niagara took this tack. To use an excuse that the DA would not prosecute a case when the injured party has died, is nonsensical. First Niagara staff has not been timely, responsive or honest in their dealings with me and my sister. They obviously hoped we would not find paperwork that had been filed so that they could use that as a reason.

181627,Debt collection,"On XXXX/XXXX/2015, we moved out of XXXX XXXX due to issues that are not a part of this complaint. XXXX XXXX was appropriately notified and we were told that we will receive a statement with a payment due if any repairs are needed. We never received one. We do have mail forwarding service and all other mail came. 
By XXXX/XXXX/2015, we were already moved into our new house, but we did not receive a statement, or a bill. 
At that point I called, and found out that there is a bill and that we owe XXXX {$280.00} for carpet repair. I was surprised, but I asked for the bill. XXXX told me she will send it ( they already had new address on file since it was provided a month before a move out ). Two weeks passed, but we still had not bill, or statement. 
Eventually, just to get this over with, I stopped at the office to pay it off on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and handed XXXX a cashier 's check for {$280.00} payable to Residences At XXXX XXXX. She assured me this is the last time we will see each other. 
To my surprise, on XXXX/XXXX/2015, I received a notice from a debt collector for {$280.00} I owe to Residences. 

To sum up, I was reported to collection agency after the debt was paid in full to manager on staff that day. Also, I received no resolution from them at this time. Mine, and my fiance 's credit is likely to be affected. 

At this point, it has to be either ill-will, or gross incompetence. It is difficult for me to understand it as I gave all parties ample time and opportunity to settle all issues."

720451,Consumer Loan,"On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I was contacted by an agent named XXXX at Springleaf. She advised me that my installment payment of {$170.00} due on XXXX XXXX, 2016 had not been received. I informed XXXX that I had excessive monthly obligations and would be paying late. She offered me a deferment under the condition that I make the XXXX payment that day, which I did. However, I did n't realize that I had paid {$1.00} short so XXXX called back the next day - at which point I paid another {$2.00} and XXXX confirmed the deferment agreement would be mailed to my home address. I received the deferment agreement a few days later. It was dated XXXX/XXXX/16 and signed by an employee named XXXX XXXX. I signed it on XXXX XXXX, 2016, made a copy, and placed it in the outbound bin at work. I continued to receive what I believed were collections calls from Springleaf, which I did not answer. Fast forward to today ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ) I received another call from Springleaf. The agent ( I did n't get his name ) advised me that my XXXX payment was past due. I told him that my XXXX and XXXX payments were deferred per the agreement I received. He explained that there was no deferment in place because the document was not received timely. When I protested he confirmed that Springleaf did not receive my deferment agreement until XXXX/XXXX/16. He stated that the XXXX payment was now due in addition to the XXXX payment, due tomorrow, XXXX/XXXX/2016. I told him that according to the deferment agreement, my next payment was n't due until XXXX/XXXX/2016. He stated "" it is n't supposed to say that '' which alarmed me because Springleaf has apparently sent me an ERRONEOUS deferment agreement WHICH THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HONORED in the first place. He stated that Springleaf only offers "" half deferments '' and "" 1 month deferments ''. He then tried to blame me for Springleaf 's failure to credit the deferment agreement to my account by saying the phone calls I was receiving "" should have triggered '' me to know something was wrong! 

I asked to speak to a supervisor and was connected to XXXX XXXX. XXXX confirmed that there were "" INCONSISTENCIES '' in the deferment agreement. However, per XXXX the "" root cause of all of this '' was the fact that the agreement was n't received timely. I acknowledged to XXXX that perhaps the mailroom at my job lost the envelope prior to mailing, as the previous agent did confirm that the envelope was post-marked XXXX/XXXX/16 from zip code XXXX ( my office location ). Then XXXX stated that the image of the envelope in Springleaf 's records DID NOT show the zip code it was mailed from - which means the previous agent lied to me when I asked him to confirm. In any event, my contention is that Springleaf would not have honored the agreement in the first place because it apparently offered terms that were not in line with Springleaf 's deferment programs. XXXX XXXX would not explain why an erroneous agreement which would have extended my maturity date, thus re-amortizing the loan ( hence the lower "" new payment amount ), was sent to me. Instead, he started to scrutinize the fact that I did not answer Springleaf 's phone calls. He then stated that the agreement would NOT have extended the maturity date ( even though it clearly says that it does ), so I would have had a BALLOON PAYMENT at maturity ( not stated in the agreement whatsoever ), and that I did not send the agreement by the due date indicated on the agreement ( there is no due date on the agreement ). I asked XXXX XXXX to pull my phone calls with XXXX since he claims that she notated in my account that the deferment was due by the end of the month. I contend that she did not. Regardless, I simply ca n't account for what may have transpired in the mailroom at my job. The reps I spoke to today simply were n't willing to make any effort at remedying this situation. I do n't have the funds to pay at this time which is why I asked for help."

348351,Consumer Loan,I financed an auto loan with Santander Consumer USA. I have made my payments ahead of schedule and I have never been late on a payment. They are stating the interest is accruing on a daily basis since the last payment was made even if the payment was early. I have paid so much in interest to the company and hardly any of it was applied to the principle. I am currently locked out of my online account with Santander because I complained to them about the payments being misapplied. I am in fear they will repossess the car even though my account is current. This company needs to be shut down immediately. There are numerous complaints on this company.

My Macy 's statement comes XXXX XXXX, 2016 and upon close review, the payment I made with certified funds was reversed and interest charges attached to my account in the amount of {$10.00}. At no time has Macy 's ever notified me of an issue with the money order, no letter in the mail, no copy of the money order used. When I called, they tried to put the duty on me to prove the payment went through. I informed her that without a copy of the money order, I 'm not able to go to the bank and do anything and that they had an obligation to let me know of the issue 3 months ago when the payment was made not 3 months later by reversing the payment and charging me interest. It seems to me that Macy 's is in the habit of waiting an excessive amount of time and are not notifying consumers when issues arise with the payment. In this case, I explicitly asked the Macy 's customer service representative if they take money orders and stated yes and processed the payment and handed me a receipt. Based on this experience, who knows how may other consumers they have pulled this slight of hand and are charging back interest on purchases people believed to have been paid in full."

I waited over 5 days to hear back from him, meanwhile the realtor is awaiting this information. I had to send him a follow-up email on the status. 

He stated, "" Good luck, you will need it. '' I then got upset because his customer service skills were horrible. I advised him I would never deal with him or Green Tree due to his poor communication skills.

773792,Credit card,"I mistakenly underpaid my XXXX credit card balance to Bank of American by {$10.00}. The amount due was {$730.00} and I paid {$720.00}. As a result, interest was charged to my account the following month. However, that particular month I had an unusually high bill because I had gone on vacation : total new charges were {$5300.00}. Nevertheless, the bank charged me interest on that amount in addition to the unpaid {$10.00} balance. This was keeping in line with their policy of charging interest on newly accrued charges if the previous month 's balance was not paid off in full. As a result, {$39.00} in interest was charged to my account. I did not notice the charge until the following month. Even though I paid the {$5300.00}, the following month I was charged {$44.00} in interest because of the {$10.00} balance which I had not noticed. After calling the bank to explain the situation, they agreed to refund the second interest charge "" as a courtesy '' but not the first. I do question the ethics of having a rule that allows interest to be charged on newly accrued balances regardless of the past amount due. I have a history of always paying off my credit card balances in full and have always been a good customer. This however, did not sway the bank whose customer service representative stated to me that she thought their offer was "" more than fair. '' I disagree. To have to pay {$39.00} in interest on an unpaid {$10.00} balance when I have been an outstanding customer for many years seems unreasonable and I would like this amount refunded."

Police reports were made to the XXXX XXXX Police Dept ( city where wallet was stolen ), and to XXXX XXXX Police Dept ( city where the frauds occurred ). Videos of the person ( s ) using the cards are available at the respective stores but will not be released to me, awaiting PDs collection, On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, I realized the Debit Card was frauded ( debit card used fraudulently on XX/XX/XXXX ) when I checked my account and immediately reported it to HSBC Fraud Dept. Note that I was immediately informed of a fraud situation by HSBC for my stolen Credit Card on XX/XX/XXXX itself, but could not stop the transaction of over {$810.00} on the Credit Card. A transaction of {$820.00} on the credit card was stopped however at about the same time. That said, I was not informed of the debit card situation on the XX/XX/XXXX by HSBC, which was frauded within about a 30 mins timeframe from the Credit Card. 

I have been working with HSBC Fraud Department ( contact as below ), primarily with XXXX XXXX, since XX/XX/XXXX. Since then, I have provided HSBC Fraud Dept with both the police reports, and have had numerous conversations with their CS Fraud Reps, and with XXXX ( over 5 calls, possibly more ). They have records of the conversations in their CS logs. Many excuses were raised as to why they are not moving on the case and refunding me the money on this case, the bottom line after many conversations, they are waiting for the PDs to "" do something '' with the case - unfortunately, it seems like the PDs are ignoring this case and are not investigating for whatever reasons. I am stuck between the PDs and a huge bank that does not seem to care to want to take care of the fraud situation but is sitting on the case, seemingly to wait for the time to expire. 

I would appreciate it if you can help as I do not have any more data to provide HSBC as to my innocence - unless I am lying in the police reports, which I am not, and the videos should demonstrate that, I do not see what else I can do on my end, with both the PDs and HSBC.

They had finally provided chipped cards but I saw on their form I had to use the last XXXX digits of my Social Security number as part of my ID. I said I did not want to do that because of the exposure to hacking it would enable and right then, they closed my existing non-chipped card and the chipped one which I had never agreed to signing up for. My credit report must look awful. 

I am confused and I am also profoundly deaf and banks are not easy for me because they wo n't do anything on line so I have to drive there every time there is the slightest issue. Well this is a big issue and I am learning from other people that most of the banks are doing the same thing - demanding people use XXXX digits of their Social Security card which is then put on their huge on-line systems. 

This makes no sense given the hacking situation where even federal employees data has been hacked en masse. Are banks allowed to do this and ask for those XXXX digits as part of an ID system? I do understand they need the entire Social Security number for various reasons but think that should be segregated from every day transactions. Are we as citizens being forced to put ourselves in unnecessary risky situations and if so, why? Interestingly I do n't have to provide that data for a debit card so I do n't understand why they are putting FDIC backed accounts at risk and why they are allowed to do it.

316311,Student loan,"Hello, I 've now been out of Navient 's autopay system for two months. The reason I declined autopay was because, all my loans were lumped into one payment. I wanted individual loans so I could pay more than my minimum payment each month on certain loans. So after being harassed by Navient for wanting to change my loans ( all within my rights ), this was finally done back in XXXX. Furthermore, after I made my XXXX payment, 3 days in advance of due date. The first issue, after the payment was removed from my bank account and cleared. Navient had my account showing past due, I was receiving emails and messages related to my account being past due on the due date. All this was happening, while my bank account was already debited for my student loan account. After calling Navient, they removed the past due and apologized. Now we are in XXXX and I paid my bill 2 days before due date. The payment has now cleared my bank, however, now my Navient account is showing past due. How is this fair and legal? 

I have paid my bill on time and the money has been cleared from my bank account. However, navient has the criminal negligence to put my account past due. This is absurd. Additionally, I try to call and there is a 30 min wait time. I believe Navient is mad that I took my account out of Auto-pay and requested my loans not be grouped together, so I can pay off my loans faster. Please look into this matter. 

Thank you."

576947,Bank account or service,"Hello, Thank you for your concern. What follows is what happened. 
Moved into new purchased home XX/XX/2016. Solicited by Equity Plus, Customer Service number XXXX. Selling a service to us, to collect our mortgage money twice a month and pay our lender. Did not sign anything, only spoke to them over the phone. Never received any information in the mail after speaking to them. no service rep ever called me. 

We thought this was something we might like to do, mortgage pay off early. It was sold to me, with the added assurance and security, they would never BEGIN the program, if I called and told them not to draft my account. And they never did. I never got anything going with equity plus, except to call them and tell them, we could not commit to any of the arrangements and politely ask them to continue to stay out of our account. They never took a single draft. We never received any information or signed anything, it was all verbal at no risk or so thought. 
Not so much. 

After one year of not doing any business with them, I called and said no thank you we are not going to be able to use this service, we ca n't get ahead and do it your way. My husband is ill, always paying hospital bills, we just ca n't get {$500.00} extra money together to start your program. Thank you but no thank you. 

Then the lady proceeded to tell me how they were going to charge my account, roughly {$350.00}, for service they never provided and we never officially or otherwise requested they provide. I argued, when we begin the program I said yes, then you can have your {$350.00} but not in the event we do no business! Things got heated on the phone when I tried to tell them to stay out of my account, spoke to supervisor who said she would invoice me. 
I have no idea how this company thinks they 're entitled to {$350.00} for picking up the phone half a dozen times to find out they did n't have a client, we were NEVER ready to commit to anything! Other than the many times we were solicited by mail to join equity plus, they never generated a stitch of paper on our behalf. They want hard currency for virtually nothing. Please do n't let equity plus do this to people, we were scared to death to provide them all the information about our bank account and our mortgage! We only had a certain amount of time before the offer expired, we had to give them everything they wanted in order to be eligible for a future payment. Their flyer had an expiration to join for our new mortgage. These people are crooks, perhaps they do a fine job when it works, but if they do n't do anything for you they still want paid. From people who could n't EVER afford to get going with it. We did not seek them out, they preyed on us. we ended up with a hurricane relief program with our lender over the course of our first year. There were times during that we could n't even pay the mortgage. Nevertheless equity plus provide no service but they did provide plenty of intimidation, and plenty of threating of my bank account on the way out. It got ugly and I lost my cool over the lack of common sense of it all. {$350.00} for nothing. I was n't on my best behavior. No excuse and I regret things got out of hand. I called them six times to let them know they did n't have a client! What they are asking now is unreasonable and erroneous. Seemed like I would easily have legal grounds as they indicated was my right, I was infuriated to say the least, at no point in that first conversation did they ever warn me about taking my money anyway. Defies common sense. Am middle-aged and beginning to think everything is a scam, since I do n't recognize the world I 'm living in, when a company can behave this way. This is not right. 

Thank you sincerely for your time"

My creditworthiness as is reflected by my credit report is excellent as is reflected in my credit score, etc. I have had my account with HSBC for over twenty years when you include the bank that HSBC merged with. I have always gone above and beyond to exercise due diligence with HSBC by for example putting a seven year fraud alert on my credit report when I got a letter from XXXX that someone had attempted to fraudulently open a line of credit with them in my name last year. In addition, I purchased a one year subscription to XXXX Protect My ID service after I got that letter from XXXX alerting me that someone had fraudulently attempted to open a line of credit in my name. I have always been a creditworthy customer of HSBC who has always followed the protocols of HSBC bank. In fact, inasmuch as, HSBC bank over the years has made numerous solicitations for me to open up a line of credit with HSBC and I have refused when I got such a solicitation from HSBC I was shocked that they refused to offer me their credit card. Not only was I shocked but the credit reporting agencies were shocked and said it was discrimination, inasmuch as, I have an excellent credit report and I have always been a creditworthy customer of HSBC bank. Not to mention I have no outstanding debt with any financial institution, no credit card, etc. 
I was shocked when my HSBC branch manager XXXX wrote me in XXXX that she was closing my HSBC checking account. I contacted HSBC and was informed that they have the right to arbitrarily close even someone like me an always creditworthy customer who has always followed all of the protocols of HSBC and who has always done due diligence when there has even been the slightest problems. Even after I informed XXXX and HSBC customer relations, and HSBC investor relations that it would be an extreme hardship for HSBC to close my HSBC checking account because I am on my way back to the USA and I need to have the liquidity of access to my funds via my HSBC bank account, because it is virtually impossible for me to open a checking account in XXXX and therefore virtually impossible for me to get a check cashed in XXXX, because I am only vacationing in XXXX, I am not going to establish residency in XXXX through the immigration services in XXXX.

309773,Mortgage,"Here are several letters I wrote Bank of America. 

XXXX XXXX Dear : Office of the PresidentXXXX XXXX XXXX I am writing you in a complete distraught and devastating state. I applied for a modification last year XXXX, in which I was approved for a trial payment in the amount of {$1000.00}. I paid each payment in this amount for 3 months and even months after while I was being told that my permanent documents were being prepared. Every time I called my account manager, for a total of XXXX to 6 months after the trial had ended, although I still made my payments, the customer relationship manager kept telling me the same thing. I ended up getting the case escalated just to find out that the amount I given was made an error and they had to get out a new trial package in the amount of {$1000.00}. Since it was an error, the trial would start over for another 3 months. Although I was thinking I was finally getting this past me, I agreed and waited on the new agreement to arrive. The new agreement arrived in XXXX XXXX, I signed the documents on XXXX XXXX, placed the account number on the top of each page, faxed the documents to XXXX AND went to XXXX and handed the clerk my envelope, as it was a long line, she said since it was prepaid all I had to do was drop it off, which is what I did. 

Several days after, I called my account manager and asked if they 've received my documentation. He put me on a brief hold, came back and said, "" yes you are all set. We do have your package on file. '' Then he proceeded to tell me to continue to make the {$1000.00} payment by calling him over the phone, or any customer service rep that could take the payment. I also got a call from my CRM XXXX XXXX last month on XXXX XXXX just checking in as he 's required to do every 30 days, and he also took my XXXX payment over the phone for the trial period amount. We spoke about the month of XXXX XXXX, being my last trial payment and to wait for permanent modification documents soon after. I was excited to know that this was almost over. 

Well unfortunately, XXXX XXXX, I opened a document saying that I have been denied my trial modification due to failure to return the signed trial modification agreement. Now again, not only did I fax the document and send a hard copy via XXXX but I called my CRM ( customer relationship manager ) who 's supposed to be managing my account and working on behalf of my modification confirm receipt. Now I get to this point just to feel like once again, I am starting all over!! I called the appeals department and she opened up an appeal, stating that she does not see my paper work anywhere in the system, and she stated that maybe XXXX saw the first modification filed documents and assumed those were the new ones ( the ones with the ERROR in payment amount. ) I made copies of what I sent, dated exactly on the date I sent them which I have attached. I am feeling as if I 'm being sabotaged. Why would I be making a payment of the exact amount of the trial period if I did n't even agree to it? I 've now made all of my trial payments in the amount of {$1000.00}. Just to get this letter in my final month? I 'm so disappointed in this system. I 'm thinking the CRM and Bank of America is there to "" help '' Well I need HELP! I do n't know what else to do, thinking I covered all basis, making my payments every month, and ready to move forward with my life, just to be set completely back. 

XXXX XXXX, I am pleading for help. I 've made the appeal, and now I 'm told I just have to wait for a call back ... I 'm hoping you can expedite and have someone investigate this case. I was thinking permanent docs would be in the mail, not a denial. I hope you can understand my level of frustration throughout this entire process. This is very unfair and unfortunate for me and my family. 

Appeals have denied and closed my case, I am disputing this denial."

I am again recording a complaint about the practice for XX/XX/XXXX. During the year, I was charged overdrafts for either ( i ) processing items that were in an amount far less than {$35.00}, ( ii ) where the associated overdraft was less than {$35.00}. In there was one instance where I was charged for an overdraft of {$17.00} or ( iii ) charged multiple times where the processing sequence of items was completed such that the largest item was processed first and then each smaller item would generate a fee.

392225,Student loan,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Fed Loan Servicing inaccurately reported, previously cleared, information causing XXXX XXXX 's credit score to drop approximately XXXX points. To make matters worse there is no record that the report from XX/XX/XXXX occurred and came to fruition only after he tried to make arrangements with Fed Loan Servicing for a forbearance. He was re-assured in a phone call to Fed Loan Servicing XX/XX/XXXX that no negative credit reporting was scheduled to occur, yet within 30 days of that phone call negative information posted to his account. Fed Loan servicing inaccurately reported negative credit information on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This has created financial difficulty for XXXX XXXX. He has been financial burdened from the mistake and the information on his credit report is not accurate. He has had difficulty from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX accessing credit, student loans, moving, car loans, and had to pay higher interest on debt as a result of inaccurate reporting. All previous negative credit reporting from XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX had been removed from the credit report ( by XX/XX/XXXX ) but now is inaccurately shows as 120 - 149 days late in XX/XX/XXXX ( as if default occurred XX/XX/XXXX ). Fed Loan Servicing illegally reported inaccurate information by changing the date of the already vindicated delinquency from XX/XX/XXXX. This Fed Loan servicing report is against the law because they re-reported previous delinquency from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( which was removed XX/XX/XXXX ). This is against FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A which states : "" it 's illegal to report information that you know or believe is inaccurate ... '' XXXX XXXX was unable to access financial resources as a result negative credit reporting because Fed Loan re-aged ( inaccurately changed the date of the first delinquency and has no record of doing so ) which is duplicative reporting and is in violation of the CRA Appendix A to Furnisher Rule Part 660. This rule says that a reporting agency must follow policy and procedures to prevent re-aging ; which Fed Loan Servicing failed to do as evidence by their denial of appeal."

687922,Mortgage,"On Friday XXXX XXXX, 2016 I made a payment thru ditech 's online payment system, in the amount of {$800.00}.

Because the ditech debit transaction debited my checking account, I did not feel it necessary to follow up to be sure that the payment was properly applied. On Wednesday XXXX XXXX, 2016 between XXXX and XXXX, I received a call from someone named "" XXXX XXXX '' at extension XXXX requesting that I make a payment on my supposed delinquent mortgage. I informed XXXX XXXX that I had made a payment via ditech 's online payment system for {$800.00}. She then replied yes, I see that payment, because it was paid early it was applied as a principle payment, not a regular loan payment. XXXX XXXX explained that this will be straightened out in 24 to 48 hours, and she was reallocating my payment for me. I thanked her, and we both hung up. The following day, Thursday XXXX XXXX between XXXX and XXXX I received a call from someone at ditech named "" XXXX '' who informed me that the purpose of the call was to collect a debt. XXXX informed me that I needed to make a payment on my delinquent mortgage. I explained to her that I had spoken with XXXX XXXX the previous day, and this matter should be resolved. She replied "" I 'm sorry sir, you are correct, I show the payment has been made, and I will make sure you do not receive any further calls ''. I have not received any further telephone calls. 
I received in my mailbox on XXXX XXXX a late notice, dated XXXX XXXX, 2016, and my billing statement, dated XXXX XXXX, 2016.

I have made numerous telephone calls, and spoken with service reps, supervisors, and a ditech director. All of them agree that I made my payment on time, and that the payment was misapplied by ditech, but none of them are willing to make this correction for me, and insist that the research department has to investigate first. It has been well over a week, and I have been unable to get this corrected ; ditech refuses to connect my phone call to someone that can correct this mistake. It has now come to the point in time where another payment is due, and I am concerned that this payment will also be misapplied. The other problem is the modification of my mortgage loan from a fixed rate loan to an adjustable rate. Nobody can explain how this happened, or how it is going to be corrected. I seem to have no other recourse with ditech, as I can not get any resolution to their mistake, employees are unwilling ( claim to be unable ) to make the correction to their company 's mistake. I am beginning to get concerned that ditech is committing some sort of fraudulent activity, by changing my fixed rate mortgage to a variable rate, and by misapplying my payment, it shows my account as delinquent ; and will start causing late fees to be applied. The initial late fee was reversed after the first telephone contact, but I am concerned about this company 's future actions."

And even in 2000 the credits were n't transferable, but we as students were never told this when we applied for financial aid.

Chase for several years kept on telling us we were underwater. First they said they were using a formula that XXXX used. XXXX denies getting involved with the mortgages that they invest in. XX/XX/2014, since we were underwater, we filed a request to Arizona Department of Housing for a grant. Arizona did a complete analysis of the value of our home and determined that our Home was not underwater. We sent the documents to Chase and they ignored our request. We even sent them a Agent 's opinion regarding the value of the property. Never a response. We requested several times a certified copy of the insurance policy so we could review the terms and conditions. The only response we received was a call advising us that the policy was confidential. Nothing like hiding the facts. This year we received a statement advising us that we could request the Mortgage Insurance removal. We did and we received a letter requesting over {$450.00} to review the property. Chase already had the information for over two years and they did nothing. Further, the money they want is really a penalty for the removal of insurance that, under the present value, will pay nothing. Its an illusion that the bank is merely making pure profit without any risk. This conduct is unethical and criminal, taking money for an illusion where there is no risk. We should be allowed to see the policy and the bank has the ability to verify value without making us pay money which acts as a chill from customers to request the removal of the mortgage insurance. As a simple alternative, a reasonable fee could be added to the loan without making people spent almost a year of premium to get it removed."

106318,Bank account or service,"I 'd like Chase Bank to issue a letter of explanation about a forged check on my account. It 's almost comical, but I do need the letter so i can complete the refinance of my mortgage. 
In a nutshell : Someone going by the name XXXX forged a check on my account. I alerted Chase and a day later Chase closed my account, and opened a new account in my name. 
While Chase apparently automatically forwarded other autopay orders to my new bank account, somehow the autopay for my Chase credit card - and only my Chase credit card - was not forwarded, and I missed two payments. Chase 's credit card division then reported my delinquency unleashing a cascading chain of events, as my credit rating momentarily plummeted and XXXX is now holding up my mortgage refinance until i can supply a letter of explanation from Chase. 
Chase refuses, of course to admit they goofed, and refuses even to issue a letter explaining the events that led to the late credit card payments. Meanwhile, my credit score has recovered but XXXX 's mortgage division insists on a letter of explanation from Chase before they will allow me to complete my refinancing. 

I am attaching copies of relevant correspondence. 

Please ask Chase to issue a brief letter of explanation, noting that a forged check forced the closure of my account and an oversight led to two missed credit card payments. My Chase account has a balance in excess of {$110000.00}, and the credit card bill was in the hundreds. 

Many thanks - XXXX XXXX XXXX"
419767,Debt collection,"XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that I have been a victim, and continue to be, of identity theft. over the course of the past nine months, I have had to dispute ( as fraud ) a plethora of trade lines, liens, foreclosures, collections etc. through all three of the credit reporting agencies ; XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. As of today, there is still a few companies left that vehemently refuse to remove my fraudulent debt with them even after numerous calls, over 20 x 's disputing with XXXX even though it has been indisputable that these collections are of a fraudulent nature. The name of the company is Skagit Bonded Collections. 

After speaking with them numerous times, it appears that these XXXX collections are medical bills that were apparently charged from a hospital in a town our county to which I have never frequented. even though I was a resident in the state of Washington from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, the name and previous addresses that they have on file do not match me. I have never lived at either of the addresses they claim and the debts are apparently under my name with the suffix of XXXX attached. I have sent them and the reporting agencies my passport, driver 's license, social security card and proof of current address to no avail. They continue to insist that this debt is mine and subsequently each time they report such to XXXX, it then changes my name to XXXX. I have disputed these collections every few weeks for the past 8 months and it still sits on my credit report."
717061,Credit card,"I had XXXX Capital One credit card accounts. I got be hide on the accounts and Capital One started contacting me. My wife explained that I got be hide due to me owning a business. Somehow during this time, Capital One started contacting my business ( Partnership ) and stated to my business partner about outstanding debt that they were trying to collect. Which Capital One violated the "" Privacy Act ''. Myself and my wife contacted Capital One informing them that this was a personal debt and not a business debt. We also asked them to stop calling the business and discussing my information with my partner. Then, Capital One started demanding the debt. We again contacted Capital One asking them to cease calling the business over my personal debt. A couple months later, Capital One transferred ownership to the business ( LLC ) and out of my name Capital One informed me that the debt was transferred to the business. XX/XX/XXXX the business again was contacted by "" XXXX '' and "" XXXX XXXX '' regarding the Capital One accounts. On XX/XX/2016, we reached a settlement offer with "" XXXX ''. That same day we paid the settlement offer in agreeance that the negative remark would come off my credit report. On XX/XX/2016, "" XXXX XXXX '' contacted the business and we reached a settlement offer with them for the XXXX Capital One account. In the settlement offer XXXX XXXX agreed to remove the debt from the credit file if I paid the debt that day. In which I did. Throughout the following months I ran credit reports and seen the debt still listed. I disputed the account with the credit report agencies, and got the same response. That Capital One stated that the debt was listed correctly. I again called Capital One regarding our settlement offer agreement. Never got anywhere with them. I filed a complaint with CFPB that got closed with no results. XX/XX/2016, I again disputed the accounts on my credit report. On XX/XX/2016, I received a letter that stated that "" We have reviewed our records and found that we previously responded to your request on XX/XX/2016. Based on our investigation of your records, we believe that our original determination is correct '. This was on the account ending in XXXX.

XXXX and I discussed the account and which I asked if we could settle this matter without contacting CFPB or an attorney. XXXX stated that "" XXXX and/or XXXX XXXX '' had no authority to offer and settlement offer or removal of the accounts from my credit file. I went on to explain that was part of the settlement offer if paid on the same date. I went on to express the "" Privacy Act '' violations, and the transfer of ownership. XXXX stated that she would have to investigate her records, I stated that we have already went through that process. XXXX stated that I need to spend her a copy of the settlement offer. I explained that I have already submitted these documents to them on numerous occasion with no results. I asked XXXX how we could settle this matter, and was told that the debt would continue reporting on my credit file."
616090,Credit card,"I purchased tickets for "" XXXX '' musical at the XXXX ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$330.00} on my Wells Fargo Credit Card. However I thought I selected Saturday instead of Sunday. Immediately ( less than 10 minutes ) after noticing the error, I contacted the vendor on a chat session ( only available form of communication ) and they clearly stated that they have a no refund policy/exchange policy. The only recourse in which they recommended, is that I personally resale the tickets. I then contacted Wells Fargo customer service and clearly explained the aforementioned occurrence. I alerted the representative that the conversation was on chat and once we ended our conversation, I forwarded the full chat session to the representative.I was very clear that the vendor noted the no refund and/or exchange policy. Wells Fargo credit card customer service representative told me that I would not have to pay for the tickets and to go ahead and purchase the desired tickets as long as I do not use the tickets, and the charge will be immediately removed from my account as it is in dispute. I noted that I would not even print the tickets out, so that there is no misunderstanding or no way they could claim that the tickets were used by me. Customer service noted that this claim would be sent to a specialist and that they would follow up with me within the next couple of days. I therefore proceeded to order the correct tickets. I attended the show on that upcoming Saturday. Early the next week I received a call from a specialist who fully went over what the credit card specialist will do as it relates to my claim. She used words like "" try '' and there is "" no guarantee '' that you will not be responsible for these charges. I immediately notified her that, that was not the information in which I was given when I filed the claim. She noted that, I should have not been told that and she do everything she could to fight the claim and notify her supervisor to review my claim of what I was told by the previous customer service representative. I XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that, I would be responsible for payment because the merchant policies were clear in regards to no refund/no exchanges. I immediately contacted the customer service specialist and disputed there findings based upon the direction of the first customer service representative that told me to order the 2nd set of tickets. Her actions, negated me the "" choice '' as to whether I could risk being charged for 2 sets of tickets. Had she notified me that there was no guarantee then I could have made an informed decision. I was already very clear of the merchant 's policy and standings from the chat in which I forwarded to Wells Fargo. After being on the phone disputing this for about 1 whole hour, I was told that this would be escalated to the Research & Remediation Analyst. In about a month I received the same response, that I am responsible for payment and merchange policy. I then requested for the tape to be reviewed in which the representative told me that I would NOT be responsible for payment and to order the tickets. The research analyst noted that YES in fact they pulled the taped phone call and YES she did say that I would not be responsible and to order the 2nd set of tickets. However she should n't have said that and we will use that for future training, BUT you will still be responsible for payment. I once again asked for the next level because it is unfair business practice that I was given the wrong information by a XXXX dollar company and I have to bear the burden, when the decision was taken out of my hands. The end results is that Wells Fargo is standing by their decision NOT to withdraw the charge from my account and that I am responsible for there error and they have it on tape that it is WF fault!"

They said I should of not been behind on my mortgage and they ca n't help because I should of not falling behind and if your not behind on your mortgage we ca n't help you. But, yet they state on their web site to call as soon as your not able to make your payment, and you do n't have to be behind. Allot of things these days you have to pay up front. So when I catch up to XXXX bills I 'm already falling behind on another. My hardship is going through divorce and loss of XXXX income. But they still say I do n't have a hardship. They have allowed me to make a repayment program, which I 'm very thankful because I really want to make everything possible to keep this home. So now my income is {$4900.00}. I have bills of {$5200.00}. And now they also have jumped my monthly bill for mortgage from {$1200.00} to {$1700.00} which my bills would be around {$5600.00} ( with new calculation ) and they still refuse to help."
312622,Consumer Loan,"On XX/XX/XXXX, my business partner and I purchased a XXXX Jeep Wrangler Rubicon from a person representing himself as the rightful owner. The vehicle was accompanied with a Clear, Lien Free title which we were able to verify with the state of XXXX in which the vehicle was title. We sent the title off to our agent in XXXX where we operate a business. A week later, our agent in XXXX notified us that the vehicle had been reported as stolen. How can this be if we have possession of the vehicle with a lien free title? After investigating this matter further, we discovered the previous owner, now referred to as Gentlemen XXXX, had a loan balance with CHASE BANK exceeding {$37000.00}. Gentlemen XXXX offers to purchase the XXXX Jeep Wrangler from Gentlemen XXXX and submits payment to Gentlemen XXXX in the form of a check, what type of check we do not know. Gentlemen XXXX then sends check to CHASE BANK to pay off his auto loan. 

CHASE BANK chooses to release the lien from the title, without placing a hold on the check. They did not allow it time to clear, as they 're company policy requires. Check is returned as a bad check. The premature lien release from CHASE BANK allowed the XXXX gentlemen to gain possession of the vehicle along with a clear title after apparently writing a bad check for the XXXX Jeep Wrangler. The premature lien release from CHASE BANK allows the XXXX gentlemen to resell the vehicle to my business partner and I without reason for suspicion. CHASE BANK is claiming no responsibility for the matter, in fact the customer service person in their fraud department I spoke to stated, "" it is our policy to release a lien on a vehicle immediately once we receive a check for the loan amount. '' Regulation CC of the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations allows banks to place holds on checks to prevent this fraudulent activity from happening. Under subpart C of the E-CFR, section 229.38, CHASE BANK is liable for any losses incurred."

XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Citibank because I had yet to receive my bonus. An investigation was initiated and by XX/XX/XXXX I was told that I had completed all the requirements and I need only wait until XX/XX/XXXX ( 90 days after the initial 30 days ) at the latest to receive the XXXX dollar bonus.

The branch manager has yet to respond even after I have contacted her three additional times. 

The branch manager and bankers at the branch refuse to speak to me. This is unacceptable. Citibank has violated its terms and conditions regarding this bonus, and I expect full credit of the XXXX dollars immediately."

We then later found out that people who were with Green Light were loosing their homes ; frantically scared we immediately changed to XXXX Mortgage. Once in XXXX Mortgage, we were promised from the beginning that if anything happened to my husband I will be granted to stay a year in our home. An agreement that we had was for a free consultation, which failed to happen. My husband has since passed away, and XXXX Mortgage transferred the mortgage to Champion Mortgage. I have called for months on end for the MOE Assignment to be transferred to the HUD, yet no one has returned my phone calls, leaving my house to foreclosure. I was given an extension of two 6 months, totalling for a year. I had continued calling the companies in order for the extension of 6 months to go through, but the companies who are assisting this case are not properly following steps for it to take place. Thus leaving me helpless. I was never sent any papers, and the price of the reverse mortgage is extremely high. I was never told there was going to be a lean in the house as well as that when my husband passes I 'll have to pay {$1000.00} each month.

I have not received any statements since despite calling AFM XX/XX/XXXX to point this out.I also reffered them to the original complaint number andtheir response, to which AFM ( XXXX-no last name provided ) claimed to be unaware of stating it must have been their "" compliance XXXX '' .The end result is the same, I am not receiving statements although I have continued to make my monthly payments. I have no assurance my account at AFM is being credited correctly.I have no documenatation for IRS purposes since this is a medical debt.I am inclined to stop making payments since there is no acknowledgement from AFM that I have faithfully made payments as agreed. AFM has alternated from being unduly rude to complete indifference when I contact them about this issue.At this point I would consider the debt invalid since AFM will not acknowledge my payments.AFM does deposit my check 's but again without a monthly statement I have no idea, or at this point, any faith my account is being properly credited."
397353,Student loan,"I have an unreasonably high payment and interest rate with Chase that - alone - is 20 % of my monthly income. If I were able to consolidate it with my federal loans, I would easily be able to make the payment every month. Instead, I am deferring my federal loans because they allow it, and paying my other private loans as I am able, but forced to pick and choose on a monthly basis which I am able to pay. I have looked into every possible consolidation option, but they all require a decent credit score. I have terrible credit as a result of student loans, exclusively. 
I have explored every possible option with Chase to lower or reduce or delay my payment. They are unwilling to work with me in any capacity, and have repeatedly shunned any effort that I have made to attempt a solution that is tenable. I budget very well, and I have attempted to raise my income in numerous ways. However, my negative credit is affecting my employment advancement, as many employers consider credit history, which in turn is affecting my ability to raise my income enough to meet all my payments. If I were able to consolidate with my federal loans, I would happily go on income-based repayment and repay the loan faithfully until it is paid in full, but this is somehow still not an option, and I did n't understand the difference when I was XXXX years old, and the interest rate was lower at the time than the federal loans, and thought I was making a practical financial decision. I am not attempting to shirk my responsibility, but there are some months when I decide between paying all of my loans/rent/vehicle, versus buying groceries. How is this right? What did I do wrong? What can I do now?"

I was told by DCI that they originally knew that their arrangement would not be allowed to be played out since all of the accts get recalled at month 5, so if someone makes a 6 month payment arrangment on a settlement amt then the arrangement will never be fulfilled since the acct will be recalled prior to the arrangments being satisfied in full.

They gave me a copy of the withdrawal receipt with a signature that was not mine. The bank then told me I needed to file a police report so I can get a refund. I went to the police department and they gave me a Victims Bill of Rights report. I then returned to the bank and showed them the report, and they denied it. They told me that the sheriffs department has their policy and the bank has their own policy, which means that they do n't care what other policies say unless its theirs. I then asked them, is there any proof that you can show me to prove it, such as security videos of that day showing who withdrew that money from my account. The bank then told me that I had to subpoena them in order to see the videos or pictures. I went to the sheriff 's department and spoke to the detective so they can subpoena the bank, which was on XX/XX/2016. A month later the bank said they do n't have any pictures or videos who told the sheriff 's department. The sheriff then told me that there is nothing they can do for me."

331131,Debt collection,I was hospitalized XX/XX/XXXX. There was a bill for XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$36.00}. That was paid on XX/XX/XXXX and posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. I first learned of this deby when applying for a home loan. I have contacted XXXX XXXX numerous times to let them know that this was not accurate and to please verifiy the balance with the client. Fox Collection refused and failed to follow up and thus knowingly continued to report negative items to the credit bureaus. They said that I had to submit proof of payment I finally had to reach out to XXXX XXXX XXXX and have them reach out to settle the matter. Unfortunately this does not erase the 8 months of a negative collection on my credit reports that was an error to begin with. Fox Collection Company displayed blatant disregard in handling my account. I have spoken to numerous account reps and even left voicemails to the Collections Manager that went unreturned. Unfortunately Fox Collections was wrong when they stated that is was my responsibility to prove the debt was not accurate. In fact I have recently learned that its their responsibility to verify the validity of the debt. At no point have I ever recieved a letter regarding this debt. I would assume that they have the wrong address however despite numerous conversations no one asked me to verify my mailing address. Due to Fox Collections reporting this negative and false collection to credit bureaus this has caused me many issues as a collection looks really bad and lowers my scores and this has even affected my homeowners insurance and car insurance rates as they do look at credit factors.

418726,Mortgage,"Dear CFPB : This matter is INCREDIBLY time sensitive. SunTrust Mortgage is preventing my wife and I from attaining a home loan. They have misreported our credit in XXXX major ways, which is creating a hard-stop from us putting an offer on the home of our dreams. They have been largely unresponsive, have lost documents, refused to cooperate, been outride rude, indolent, slow-moving, and incredibly difficult to reason with. 

Overview of Situation : We obtained a loan from SunTrust Mortgage in XXXX of XXXX. SunTrust thinks we were foreclosed on, when in actuality we completed a successful short sale with them on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. They erroneously reported this transaction to the credit bureaus as a foreclosure and will not remove it. In addition, they reported to the credit bureaus that we have a 90 day late on a mortgage as of XXXX XXXX. This is absurd. We did n't even have a mortgage with them in XXXX. Everything was complete via a short sale in XXXX. We have been renters since XXXX. 

We have provided SunTrust with the information that clearly shows they were in error so that we could obtain a pre-approval letter from our lender and purchase a home to raise our son in. All that we asked for from SunTrust was : 1 ) a letter stating that they did not foreclose on us ; it was a short sale completed with settled deb and that we were never late in XXXX, as we had already sold the home and were renting 2 ) Contact the credit bureaus and re-report this information. 

The below documentation was provided to SunTrust 's loss mitigation department and Mortgage Escalation Group : The HUD-1The short sale settlement and acceptance letter sent to us by SunTrust Mortgage in XXXXThe Grant Died that shows when then transaction was completed and the final dispersement from title that shows the money paid in full to all parties. 
The Closing Statement from escrow that outlines the entire transaction. 

Our credit report that shows the 90 day late that SunTrust reported to the credit bureaus in XXXX of XXXX, when we did not even own a home. 

After countless hours invested in trying to reason with SunTrust 's loss mitigation department and providing them all of the documentation they need to prove that we executed a short sale with them in XXXX, we received a letter in the mail on XXXX XXXX stating that SunTrust had completed its investigation and they are correct ; we are wrong. The matter was even turn over to SunTrust 's "" Escalation Group '' to no avail. XXXX in the escalation group conceded that they only had XXXX staff members and were behind. I begged him to look at our case because of the timing issue of putting an offer in on the house. My begging accomplished nothing. 

The lack of information and sensitivity to a very time sensitive home purchase, as a result of SunTrust 's egregious servicing practices, has directly and solely impeded our ability to buy a house. They are like talking to a wall. They have hung us out to dry and we have zero recourse. 

Sincerely and Regretfully, XXXX"

The previous mortgage company did a loan modification with us, the new deal was they gave us a balloon payment of {$15000.00}, to be paid at the end of the loan, so we signed the agreement. The current mortgage company demanded that we pay the balloon payment the XXXX month they had the loan, it took us almost 1 year to straighten this out, every time we called there was someone new assigned to our loan. I believe they charged us interest on the balloon payment during the dispute period. Every time we ask for paperwork they say we have to submit the request in writing and when we call back after a month they say they already mailed it and we must resubmit the request again. 
We made a payment on the principle last year but they still show the same payoff date on our statements, and the interest payments are n't going down in size by very much. 
We made another payment this year on the principle and we asked them the same questions and they say we must request information in writing, so again we requested the payment schedule from them and we called them back after a month and they said they had already mailed it XXXX XXXX and today is the XXXX and they said on the XXXX they would mail it again and we still have n't received anything from them."

They do not give the option of inputting a set amount that I would like to pay on a monthly basis. The problem is the minimum balance is always "" XXXX '' and I 'm clearly not in a position to totally pay off the balance ; which Chase is aware off because I would not have transferred the balance. 
I believe this is fraud, and clear intentions to not have the credit pay-off before the introductory rate being offer expires. 
Just to note, I have the option of a set amount for all of my other credit cards. This seems to be only a practice of Chase. 
Please advise..

Refuse to do anything about the charge. I think this is an abusive practice.

516560,Mortgage,"I received an escrow analysis statement from Chase dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX showing that my escrow was short by {$24000.00} and that my payment was going to go from {$1500.00} to {$2200.00}. This analysis included a "" what should have happened to your escrow account '' scenario as well as a "" what actually happened to your escrow account '' section. Each month, of my {$1500.00} mortgage payment, {$770.00} is the portion that is to go to my escrow account. However, according to the "" what actually happened to my escrow account '' analysis, this {$770.00} was not posted to my escrow account each month. Instead, some months show {$0.00}, and other months have a negative payment to my escrow account ( and these are not the payments TO my taxes and insurance ). At $ XXXX, in a twelve month period I contributed {$9200.00} to my escrow account, however Chase only shows {$5500.00} worth of payments to my escrow account-where is this missing money? I completed a second loan modification in XXXX, XXXX. The reason I had to complete a second modification was because the during the first modification that was completed in XXXX, Chase forgot to include escrow. When I caught this error in XXXX and brought it to the attention of Chase proactively, I was told that this was the fault of Chase, and that they would resolve the error. In the interim, I continued to make my payments on time per the modification agreement. Since Chase was then saying I owed more each month ( because of the escrow ), but we had n't resolved this with a new modification, Chase began reporting me late and began foreclosure proceedings on my home. I originally filed a complaint regarding this situation with the CFPB ( complaint # XXXX ) along with multiple letters to Chase, state representatives, etc. This went on for years and was finally resolved when Chase agreed to "" forgive '' the accrued debt of around {$18000.00} at that time. This was agreed upon during a recorded phone call with XXXX XXXX XXXX at the Chase Executive Office on XXXX XXXX, XXXX at XXXX XXXX. Also during that phone call, per XXXX XXXX XXXX, the escalated underwriter had identified an error on the original modification, new terms and conditions were reviewed, the new P & I amounts were reviewed ( years XXXX at 2 % P & I= {$810.00}, escrow {$750.00}, year XXXX at 3 % P & I= {$840.00}, escrow {$750.00}, year XXXX at 4 % P & I= {$1000.00}, escrow {$750.00}, remaining years at 4.75 % P & I= {$1100.00}, escrow {$750.00} ), my modified principle balance was going to be reduced from {$260000.00} to {$260000.00}, no lump sum was due from me, and a work order was going to be submitted in regards to Chase reporting my payments as "" late '' back to XXXX to repair my credit. A new modification agreement was sent to me and I signed and returned it on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Included with the new modification agreement was a four-page document that showed that my escrow was short by {$4200.00}, however the escrow analysis statement dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX shows that my escrow balance was negative {$15000.00} at the time of the second modification. This can not be possible. First and foremost, the debt from the first modification was forgiven in a recorded phone call. Second, Chase ca n't keep making up random numbers a year later that contradict a legal binding document sent to me a year ago. This contradiction of of an underfunded escrow account of {$15000.00} vs. {$4200.00} needs to be fixed by Chase. Now they have once again caused errors to my loan, and have caused my payment to increase ( which I ca n't afford and defeats the purpose of requesting a loan modification ). I was told by XXXX XXXX at the Chase Executive Office on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX to fax in whatever "" evidence '' I had that supported my position, which I did today, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

When I called Capital One Auto finance on Friday XXXX/XXXX/17 to pay the remaining balance on my auto loan, using my XXXX XXXX card -- approx XXXX, I was told the payment which I made prior to XXXX, would not be processed until Monday. This really upset me because there was no valid reason why the payment could not be processed the same day. I was told becasue the weekend was coming up the payment would not be processed until Monday XXXX/XXXX/17, and they would not count the 5 days to get my title from Friday XXXX when I made payment, but would could 5 days from Monday XXXX. Though they told me I should see payment post in my account over the weekend, when I checked on Sunday XXXX, I noted nothing was done, no XXXX payment was pending from my checking account. I called XXXX Bank to find out if Capital One processed any such payment and was told No. I also noted in my account -- -- when I made $ XXXX to Capital One Auto Finance on XXXX/XXXX/17, the payment was not processed by them until Friday XXXX/XXXX/17. These practices made by Capital One Auto Finace to delay my payemnt and what it seems to collect more interest on my loan is VERY DECEPTIVE PRACTICE. I had more than enough money to pay my loan in one day and be done, but XXXX Bank wanted to dictate to me how much of my own money I can spend in a given day which is so ridiculous. Thanks to both these institutions, there is now a delay in getting the title for my car and selling it to my buyer. This also causes a delay in me purchasing a new car, because I was going to use profit from money I get from seller to put a downpayment towards an new car. Banks and financial institutions should never have such dictatorship & power over consumers. When this mess is finally cleared I will no longer do business with XXXX Bank and definitely not with Capital One Auto Finance ever again."
230018,Mortgage,"I was interested in refinancing my existing XXXX Mortgage and I reached out to New Penn Financial ( XXXX ) starting in XXXX of 2016. Everything was approved and ready to close but on XX/XX/2016 I decided that I no longer wanted to move forward with the loan/closing. I informed XXXX of New Penn Financial on XX/XX/2016 via email. XXXX quickly reached out to my via phone in an attempt to convince me to continue working with New Penn and close out the refinance with them. New Penn has ignored multiple requests from my new refinancing company "" XXXX '' to transfer my FHA case number to allow them to lock in my refinancing rate with them. I saw this as a deliberate attempt by New Penn Financial to block me from being able to shop my refinancing options with other Mortgage Companies. Because of New Penn Financials unethical behavior my original estimated Mortgage interest rate increased from 3.37 % which is now costing me more money. New Penn Financial continues to call me 19 days later stating that they need me to telll them who to transfer the FHA case number too. This does not make any sense to me because I know that XXXX provided all the necessary to New Penn to transfer the FHA case number. All of this will now end up cost me thousands of dollars. This type of behavior should not be allowed because it cause consumers a lot of unnecessary stress. As I 'm submitting this compliant XXXX of New Penn Financial continues to reach out to me regarding the loan that I requested him to stop working on 19 days ago. XXXX emailed me on XX/XX/XXXX stating "" I see you made your XXXX payment. We can still do the loan for you and close in XXXX '', again after I informed him on XX/XX/XXXX that I decided not too move forward with New Penn. This sounds like New Penn continues to work my loan and pulling my credit report, which is going to show as additional inquiries. I 've informed New Penn Financial thatI plan on working with another institution so why are they continuing to utilize my information?

I have received other gift cards that did not require any personal information at all to activate it. I called an inquired why this is, they did not offer a reasonable explanation except to say it was for my security. If that was true they would not ask. Each time you give someone your social security number out increases the chances you will become a victim of credit fraud. 

I had no idea how much was on the card ( it was a gift ) apparently just asking for the balance costs XXXX cents each time you ask. So when I asked it had a balance of {$24.00}. 

Each time the card is used there is a fee charged. {$1.00} to run as debit and {$2.00} to run as credit for each transaction. 

This company is unscrupulous in their business practices and I have to wonder how they are able to do business in this country. To anyone who reads this I would not use this company for anything!!!"

I am unemployed and have very minimal income. I have exhausted my deferment, and I was refused to get on the income-based repayment plan or MGRS- modified graduated repayment schedule. 

My servicer is XXXX and the holder of my student loans is Access Group. Both refused to provide me with an income-based repayment plan, and here is why- I was on the income-based repayment plan but still had a hard time making payments. XXXX ' representative offered me a deferment for three months ( which would exhaust my deferment ) and then get back on MGRS. My three-month-deferment just ended. To my surprise, following the deferment period, XXXX advised me that the MGRS is not an option for me anymore because I can not go on and off it, and there is no other repayment option. 

Had XXXX associates been properly trained and provided accurate student loan advice to me in the first instance, I certainly would not have canceled the MGRS just for 3 months. I would have stayed on the MGRS. Clearly, my choices have been made based on false information provided to me by their servicing center. 

Now, I am without income and in a worse repayment position than I was prior to deferment. It seems nonsensical to me that I can not use an income-based repayment plan. I do not believe that XXXX and Access Group are providing me with accurate information. 

Please help me get back on the income-based repayment plan.

274175,Consumer Loan,"In a recent review of my credit report ( XXXX XXXX ) I noticed Toyota Motor Credit Corporation added inaccurate information to a trade line on my credit report that had previously been listed as paid and closed for the past five years. During my annual review of my credit report back in XXXX XXXX, I inquired about the TMCC account still remaining on my credit report after ten years and requested information be provided to validate the accuracy of the trade line and/or have it removed. Upon my request from the credit bureaus for information regarding the validity of the trade line, I was prompted to start and open an investigation per the credit bureau protocol re : the TMCC trade line. After providing the necessary information to the credit bureaus to assist with the TMCC investigation, I was given a file confirmation number as well as a tentative date when I could expect the investigation to be completed. XX/XX/XXXX I received documentation from XXXX credit bureau ( XXXX ) that the TMCC investigation had been completed and new information had been provided to update my credit report. Upon reviewing the updated information I received in the mail from XXXX re : the TMCC investigation, I became aware of the inaccurate information that TMCC had provided to the credit bureau. In the updated information TMCC provided to the credit bureau ( XXXX ) TMCC changed the {$0.00} balance paid/closed trade line that had been listed on my credit report since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to now stating that in XXXX XXXX I owe a balance of {$9400.00} which was conflicting information previously stated on my credit report for the past five years. From XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX the TMCC trade line listed a {$0.00} balance paid/closed. The new information that TMCC provided to the credit bureau was completely conflicting and contradictory from the previous information TMCC had listed on the trade line for the past five years. After reviewing the new information TMCC had provided to the credit bureau in response to the investigation, I immediately contacted the credit bureau ( XXXX ) informing them of the discrepancy and inquiring about what action I can take to have this TMCC trade line discrepancy rectified. During my conversation with the credit bureau rep, I inquired as to what information TMCC provided to validate the new information? The credit bureau rep replied that no hard copies of any sort with my signature or any tangible documentation was provided for validation. The only response from TMCC for the new information TMCC provided to the credit bureau was that was the information TMCC had on file in their computer system regarding my account. I questioned the legality of the investigation and how it was possible for TMCC to suddenly have information in their computer system in XX/XX/XXXX stating that I owe a balance of {$9400.00} when from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( listed on my XXXX XXXX XXXX report and on my XXXX XXXX XXXX report ) to my inquiry in XXXX XXXX the account had shown {$0.00} balance and current/paid/closed. I also informed the credit bureau rep that I had requested a payment account history from TMCC back in XXXX XXXX and I was told by TMCC that no information was on file in their computer system for my past account and there was no information TMCC could provide me at the time of my request in XXXX XXXX. After further discussing the outcome of the TMCC investigation with the credit bureau rep, and being informed by the credit bureau rep that the credit bureau was unable to assist me further ; I felt the only other recourse I had was to reach out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for assistance with this TMCC matter."

Also every time I call i 'm told a different story by the person on the other end of the line. As stated before I called on XX/XX/2016 around XXXX EST. about trying to get the tax payment stopped. I was told on that phone call that since they had n't received payoff there was nothing they could do. The Next time I called was on XX/XX/2016 at XXXX. EST. at that time I figured there would 've been plenty of time for them to receive and process my refund. I was told on that phone call that processing could take up to XXXX weeks and again I was told that I could speak to no one else but the person I was speaking with. I specifically asked to speak to a manager but was told that one was not available. So I waited until XX/XX/2016 to call again figuring that would be plenty of time for processing to take place. I made that call at XXXX EST. this time I was told that processing could take XXXX weeks. Again I asked to speak with someone in the tax department and again I was told no. This time the woman told me she would put in an email to the tax department about this situation and she 'd get back with me as soon as she got a response. Today is XX/XX/2016 and I still have n't heard anything from them. In between my calls my lawyer tried to intervene due to the fact he has power of attorney for me and he was told they could n't talk to him about my loan. He also sent a letter to Shellpoing Mortgage Servicing trying to resolve this issue but we 've receive no response to that letter either. I 'm fed up with dealing with this company and am asking for your help in this matter.

We wanted only XXXX credit card with XXXX balance at the lowest interest rate we could get. If Chase Slate was not okay approving us for the full balance transfer that is fine.

523488,Credit card,I used a convienance check to deposit money into my checking account. I was charged a 3 % fee which is not too bad comparable to other cards but it was a special. When my first bill came the minimum payment was very high. I paid it and thought that they added the transfer fee to first months payment. This month I received my statement and it was high again. I called the company ( Chase ) and was told I 'm being charged 5 % of the balance for my minimum. They said it was in my terms but I have never seen that and have n't had any other credit card ask for that high of a minimum payment. I suspect they did it on purpose to make sure people ca n't make the payment and then they can charge a very high late fee and raise the interest to their highest rate.

So I messaged them to inquire why they were charging me interest, and they told me the 0 % offer was only on transfers and not on purchases, that the 0 % offer for purchases ended XX/XX/2016. I asked how the offer could expire on the day I applied and was approved for the card, ( give or take a few days ) and they kept repeating that the offer was for balance transfers. I know they are being dishonest, I NEVER open cards with an interest rate on purchases, especially one as high as they are charging me, 19.24 %. It would n't even make sense to open a card with interest on purchases, as I had many offers with 0 % I did my homework, I looked at lots of cards, and I chose this one because they offered the longest 0 % rate on purchases and transfers. I feel like they are bait and switching customers and I think it is illegal to use such deceptive credit practices."

364652,Mortgage,"In XXXX 2015, we suffered damage to our home, which resulted in an insurance claim being filed and reimbursement received. The reimbursement check from the insurance company was made payable to us as the homeowners and to the mortgage company, Nationstar Mortgage. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, we sent the check to Nationstar Mortgage for endorsement. Prior to mailing the check, I contacted Nationstar Mortgage as to the proper protocol to be followed when submitting this sort of check. I was not given any specific instructions other than a mailing address. In order to streamline the process, I thought it would be prudent to send an entire binder of information relating to this claim - paid invoices, the insurance appraisal report, a complete explanation of what damage had been incurred and the remaining work necessary in order to restore our property. I was told by Nationstar that they would contact me within two days regarding the check and the claim. 
The check and related information were delivered to Nationstar on XXXX XXXX, 2015, as evidenced by the USPS tracking information. 
We were not contacted by Nationstar within their two day promised window. Rather, they contacted us on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The representative we spoke with was completely ignorant of the situation and did not understand anything about the documents which Nationstar received. As a result, she "" rejected '' the documents and did not proceed with processing the claim. The inspection was cancelled and the claim check was left with Nationstar to languish in their system. We requested to speak with a supervisor and to have the inspection rescheduled. The representative assured us that a supervisor would call us and that the final inspection would be scheduled within the next day or two. 
By XXXX XXXX, we had received no call back from the supervisor nor were we contacted to schedule an inspection. I again called Nationstar and again the representative I spoke with was unfamiliar with the claim. She could see in the file notes that the inspection was cancelled and not rescheduled and that certain documents had been rejected. I again had to clarify the documents for her and after I explained the relevance of the related paperwork, she agreed to reschedule the inspection and accept the reports which I provided. She also informed me that the insurance reimbursement check was being returned to me for another endorsement ( from the insurance adjusting firm ) before Nationstar would accept it. 
Nationstar is extremely difficult to deal with because their customer service representatives do not understand the entire process nor do they communicate to you what is needed to complete the process. We have repair bills which need to be paid from this insurance reimbursement and Nationstar is holding up our money through their sheer and complete incompetency. They do not adhere to their promises nor their verbal representations. We have bills which must be paid through this insurance reimbursement check and due to Nationstar 's negligence, we are unable to pay them. Everytime we call them, we get the runaround. I have spent hours on the phone trying to resolve this issue."

539877,Debt collection,"Attorney firm filed a civil action suit against me in XXXX XXXX, I had requested numerous times for validation of debt they stated I owed prior to my actual hearing date & never received. 

The attorney firm & the Plaintiff in which the firm claim to represent had XXXX conflicting statement. The loan the attorney firm stated I owe ( application date XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) does not match the record of what the Plaintiff stated I owe ( application date XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). Application dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX is a denied loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( see attachment ) & should have not been disbursed to the school on my behalf ( I had already XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & did not need any additional financial aid ). The application date XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from another lender is the original loan/date in which I enrolled in school & completed all my financial aid via E-sign prior to me attending. Application XXXX/XXXX/XXXX is the proof of ownership of debt which the attorney has not provided. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at my hearing, the Attorney firm stated they would provide me documentation of this loan & I agreed to the judgement contingent upon them providing me this application dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Me not knowing or unfamiliar with how the court system work, did not get the attorney firm or the judge to write on the judgement ORDERINGthe documents in which the attorney firm and I agreed upon during litigation. It is 8 months later & the attorney firm has not provided this affidavit/documentation or even responded to any of my requests. I have been paying them as agreed & I feel the attorney firm manipulated me into signing this judgement by false representation of them claiming they had personal knowledge of the validity & ownership of debt & yet could not support their claim with basic documents even though they claim to have affidavits & proof of debt. I felt intimidated during litigation ( facing the attorney firm & another associate w/ the attorney firm vs myself ) & pressured to sign or facing the judge who would demand the full amt of the debt of $ 10,000+. I am at a lost right now as to how to move forward & cant afford a lawyer to represent me properly in this matter. 

I have been taken advantage of by the school, XXXX College ( who currently has an open pending case vs CFPB ) who mishandled & pushed my loan through to XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX ( a preferred lender of the school who had an arrangement with XXXX to sell the loan immediately after origination at a higher rate ). 

XXXX XXXX & its affiliates or subsidiaries of XXXX XXXX faced a class action ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, on behalf of all persons similarly situated vs XXXX XXXX , XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) with District Court of Connecticut for violating the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 ( c ) against XXXX XXXX individuals whom XXXX XXXX underwrote or originated a private loan between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX stating intentional racial discrimination in XXXX & underwriting of loans using school specific pricing structures which minority borrowers incur higher interest rates and fees. 

I believe XXXX College intentionally withheld my original loan with my selected lender & then waited til days upon my graduation, creating a urgency & lessen my chance to review & consider other options to pressure me to resign my loan application under a different lender ( the school preferred lender ) unknowingly. 

The reason the attorney firm cant provide a copy of the application XXXX/XXXX/XXXX is because it was done electronically by a different bank/lender. The application dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was denied & should not have ever been disbursed on my behalf because IT WAS DENIED & I never gave Transferability Consent of my E-sign loan transaction application dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to be transferred to another holder of the loan ( according to U.S. Dept of Ed concerning Electronic Student Loan Trans )"

Chase placed a 30 day late payment from me Slate card on my credit reports which I am trying to get removed. I have always paid my bills on time to Chase. This incident was not my fault as I never received any notification from Chase via paper or electronic statements. I informed them of this at the time and they were kind enough to credit the {$25.00} late fee and they understood the situation. Months later I found out that they placed a 30 day late on my credit reports which I am now trying to get removed on account ending in XXXX. 

After months of trying to get this resolved I became very frustrated and upset with Chase and ended up closing all my accounts with them which I knew would take a hit to my credit. After taking a breather I reached back out to Chase to ask if they would reinstate my XXXX Marriott Chase account as I used this account a lot for business but also stated they could keep the other accounts closed. I was then denied credit for my Marriott account which made no sense to me when my credit was perfect. So I reached out to Chase again only for them to inform me I had delinquent credit through them from year 2000. I had no idea what they were talking about and asked them if this was really the case why in the world would you issue me credit after the fact with a total credit line of {$27000.00}. I then reached out to the Chase Executive Office to figure out what was going on and received a call back. Chase then agreed to reinstate only my Marriott account but not any of my other accounts. I only asked for the XXXX account to be reinstated so I was okay with that. It still however makes no sense and seems to me there is some sort of discrimination going on here when not offering me my credit back. I have been in banking for a very long time, working at XXXX, XXXX Bank, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and holding positions of Credit Manager, Credit Supervisor, Officer, VP, Underwriter, Accountant of Treasury Control and have never seen or experienced so much misunderstanding and inconsideration by any financial organization like Chase. I have credit through many banking institutions, all of which would understand a situation like the XXXX I have with Chase that I am trying to get resolved but Chase just rubs me off saying they can not do anything which with my banking experience know this is an incorrect statement. 

I also had a {$9500.00} balance on my Marriott credit card account which now that Chase reinstated the account for me I paid off in full which now has a credit balance of {$52.00}. My question to Chase is this, why would I after 15 years of being a customer of Chase have XXXX 30 day late payment unless I was unaware of proper communication from Chase? If I had a late payment to Chase then why did n't Chase contact me with a letter or a call from customer service like most banking institutions do for notification? If this was really my fault then why did Chase credit my late payment and recognize and apologize by phone that I never received any statements of notification? I had this Slate card for over a year and never had a late payment. I had other cards up to 15 years with never a late payment. I am only asking that Chase recognize the possibility that maybe just maybe this was not my fault and it is possible I was never notified in anyway of this situation. I would ask that Chase take this into consideration and please remove the 30 day late off my Slate account ending in XXXX. Thank you"

314202,Consumer Loan,"I sent a cashier 's check to Dealer Services that was received, according to USPS, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This was a full payoff of the current automobile loan I have with Dealer Services. Dealer Services could not locate my check after I mailed it. Depending on which representative I talked to, I was told to either : wait a little longer so that Dealer Services could possibly locate the check, or go ahead and cancel the check and get a new one. Over one final conversation involving my local Wells Fargo bank manager and Dealer Services, it was agreed to cancel the check. The check was canceled that day, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Literally, the next day, Dealer Services found my check and tried to process payment, which was denied due to cancelation the day before. There is an application process that one must go through in order to get a new cashier 's check issued. I went through this process with my local Wells Fargo bank manager and was ultimately denied. The bank has a mandatory 90 day waiting period before these funds are available in my bank account. This was made aware to Dealer Services several times by the local Wells Fargo bank manager and myself. After I was denied a new cashier 's check, Wells Fargo stated that the local branch could issue me a copy of the same cashier 's check that was issued originally. If the branch could attain a photo copy of the original check, a duplicate check could be printed. The local Wells Fargo bank manager and I have contacted Dealer Services several times in an effort to get this photo copy. Dealer Services, so far, has not been able to locate my original check or provide a photo copy. The check was never mailed back to me, as would normally happen when a check bounces. Since I can not get a photo copy of the check, I must wait the mandatory 90 days until the funds are again available in my bank account. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the manger of the collections department, XXXX, suggested forbearance. I agreed to it and payed the fee. On the phone with this same manager, he said that the forbearance would last until XXXX, till when the funds for the full payoff of the car would be in my account. A week later, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, when I called back to check on my status, he stated the forbearance was grated, but for the months of XXXX and XXXX only. I reiterated the fact that I sent a payoff check that was lost by Dealer Services and I could not afford to make monthly car payments again. He stated that the forbearance could not be extended past 60 days, and since the issue dated back to XXXX, it had to cover that time. I was made aware by XXXX that the payment for XXXX is due, and that it is expected to be paid in XXXX, and then again in XXXX. During all of this, I contacted Dealer Services many times, as I was also concerned that this issue would affect my credit. I was told that a computer automatically generates the credit reporting and there was nothing they could do to stop it, even in my current situation. Dealer Services did turn me for a late payment for the month of XXXX XXXX, to the credit bureau. I then called several times again to Dealer Services, asking how this could be removed. Depending on which representative I talked to, I got several different answers. When I finally talked to the collections manager, XXXX, the first time, I was told he would personally look into getting this removed from my credit. The second conversation with XXXX went completely different. He stated that this was a multi-step process, where I had several things I would need to complete before Dealer Services would consider asking this blemish to be removed from my credit. I have involved the local bank manager of Wells Fargo, throughout most of this ordeal and the local Wells Fargo branch had does all it can do to help me in my situation.

14396,Consumer Loan,"We financed a XXXX Volkswagen XXXX which became part of the VW Diesel scandal. We opted to return the vehicle and receive the compensation that was offered. As part of the terms of settlement, our loan was to be paid off directly with the remainder of settlement funds paid directly to us. We turned in our vehicle on XX/XX/2017, and within 3 days ( as per the settlement terms ) received a direct deposit of the funds owed us beyond the financed amount. We were informed that the loan would be paid off AS OF THE XX/XX/XXXX, the date we turned in the vehicle. We were also informed that overpayment would be sent to us directly from VW Credit. In early XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter from VW Credit indicating a payoff date of XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, and we have yet to receive our check for overpayment. We had sent correspondence directly to VW Credit and informed that it could take several more weeks to receive our overpayment. Clearly, if we were several weeks overdue in making a loan payment, we would be subject to interest and late fees. The delay in receiving the refund of overpayment seems unreasonable. VW Credit has had our funds ( and those of thousands of other settlement participants ) and has benefitted from the delay in refunding overpayment to us. Our demand is as follows : 1. Payoff date to be modified to reflect a XX/XX/2017 payoff - the same date that we turned in the vehicle and no longer had use for it. 
2. Immediate payment of our reimbursement to include interest and late fees ( as would be calculated by VW Credit if our payment was late ) back dated to XX/XX/2017. 
3. An investigation into the delay and whether in the aggregate the withholding of prompt payment and failure to use the settlement date as date of loan payoff has inured to the benefit of VW Credit and against consumers."

316490,Consumer Loan,"From my experience with DriveTime, there was absolutely no reward or pleasant service once I stopped the process and questioned why the price was {$2300.00} more than originally agreed upon. As long as you are giving them a huge lump sum of money and do n't read anything you are signing, they are all smiles in your face. But as soon as you notice a mistake has been made and dispute their practices, then you become a nuisance to them. As quick as my money was taken and applied to an account that now ca n't be identified, I watched how tables turned. Customer Relations are supposed to be the highest level, but it 's comical how there is no way to identify me, but they quickly assigned me an account # that was on my receipt when they took my money!!! I have spoke to several representatives, and they all ( with the exception of XXXX ID # XXXX ) have an attitude of offense from the time they answer the phone, which is probably because they can identify who is calling with caller ID. So this could very well explain why I usually get disconnected at least once when calling for a status about my refund. When I finally get through to Customer Relations department, I get someone with a condescending tone reading me a generic script that basically says I can not get any help. If this company is all about set standards and support as they posted on XXXX, then why have I NOT received my refund of my {$1200.00} down payment yet. The manager, XXXX, was quick to print out the 'Vehicle Reservation Agreement ' when I inquired about my refund, and even highlighted the section that stated I should be receiving my refund within 7-10 business days. She handed me this paperwork, and lied to me in my face and tried to get me to believe that the 'Vehicle Reservation Agreement ' was the documentation to show where I had already paid the down payment. I knew she was lying because the dates on the paper did not reflect when I came in and made the payments. It just goes to show that XXXX uses deceptive tactics and proves to me that this is very much a common practice. The only thing that I have received within '7-10 business days ' is a letter telling me that by law they had to report this transaction ( that did n't occur ) to the credit reporting agencies. The address conveniently omitted my Unit #, which is the excuse being used as to why I did n't get my refund check yet. I am highly upset, but at the same time very thankful and relieved that I did not purchase a vehicle with this company. From my research, I have discovered they harass customers, do not report payments in good standing and furnish inaccurate information to credit reporting agencies ; among a long list of other things. DriveTime 's mission statement states "" Innovative Credit Solutions '' and "" Outstanding Customer Service '', but this is far from the truth and what they really stand for. It is absolutely awful how they advertise and try to appeal to the very consumer who they take advantage of, which are generally people who are trying to re-establish themselves. In my opinion, this company actually has the worse management and similar ( if not the same ) customer service complaints in multiple states. They use unfair tactics all while retaliating against customers who have become distressed due to their wrongdoing. This posting is a warning to others so you will not have to go through what many people have already gone through. Please do your research!!"

They state I have a LTV of 70 %. I have spoken to a licensed appraiser and a real estate agent. They value the Caliber is using is 100 % fraud.

429229,Credit card,"I decided to accept a "" 0 % interest for 18 months '' promotional offer from a retailer for {$2700.00} worth of new carpet for my home. The financing was through a new credit card from Synchrony Bank. When the first bill came, I set up automatic online payments, but miscalculated the monthly payment necessary to pay off the full amount in 18 months ( {$98.00} vs. {$150.00} ). After 19 months I received a call from Synchrony that my payment was late, and that 's when I noticed the error. I paid the remaining principle immediately, but now have to pay {$1200.00} in deferred interest ( 29.99 % APR ). I realize this is my mistake for making monthly payments less than that required to satisfy the promotion terms. I did a little research and found that this happens to about XXXX in XXXX people who sign up for these deals. I feel the whole practice of offering a program designed to slam the 20 % of people that get tripped up is predatory and slimy. I also found out that Synchrony bank ( formerly GE Capital ) is XXXX of the largest banks offering credit on behalf of retailers selling big-ticket items like carpet and appliances. It 's a multi-billion dollar business for them. I called Synchrony and talked to XXXX different customer service agents, offering to pay the 30 % APR for the two months since the promotion period ended, but received no consideration. I was told that since I accepted the initial agreement, I should have known the consequences. I feel like a fool for even falling for such a risky proposition. I just hope others will learn from my mistake and avoid Synchrony bank offers for exorbitant "" deferred '' interest rates which are effectively land mines hoping to catch consumers off guard."
249289,Student loan,"I have XXXX direct loans ( XXXX subsidized, XXXX unsubsidized ) currently serviced by Mohela. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I paid a lump sum of {$1000.00} and directed Mohela to apply the full amount to Loan XXXX, using their online payment system. The payment was applied to the correct loan ; however, my next monthly payment ( auto-debited from my bank account on XXXX XXXX, 2016 ) was not applied correctly - a small amount was applied to Loan XXXX and a larger amount was applied to Loan XXXX. 

I contacted Mohela when I realized this error and was told the revised allocation was because my account was in "" paid-ahead '' status. I asked them to edit my XXXX XXXX payment and reapply it as it was supposed to be applied per my repayment schedule and also remove the paid-ahead status - I wanted my payments to remain as they were scheduled, just with a smaller balance on Loan XXXX. I was assured that this would be taken care of and would not cause any further issues. 

My monthly payments for XXXX 2016 through XXXX 2016 ( inclusive ) were applied correctly, but my XXXX 2016 and XXXX 2016 payments were again incorrectly applied. This time, a much larger amount than scheduled was applied to XXXX XXXX and a much smaller amount than scheduled was applied to Loan XXXX. I contacted Mohela again, on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Their response indicated that they did not quite understand the problem. 

Again, Mohela said I was in "" paid-ahead '' status and that the additional payment that I made was used to satisfy future bills ( which is exactly the opposite of what I had requested when making that payment and what I discussed with them when I contacted them in XXXX 2016 ). The email response I received said, in part, "" The paid ahead status on your account is causing your Auto Debit payments to apply to your XXXX loans differently than what is displayed on your repayment summary. We are currently researching a way to ensure that your Auto Debit payments apply correctly, based on the repayment summary. Once we have completed research on how best to implement this process on your account, we will send you a subsequent secure email on mohela.com. '' I find it difficult to believe that I am the only customer in the history of Mohela and/or the XXXX to want to pay down my loans and continue to have the monthly payments allocated as indicated on my repayment schedule. I also find it incredibly convenient on Mohela 's end to use this excuse - the goal in my paying extra on the loan is to reduce interest over the course of the loan, something Mohela has a vested interest in preventing. They show no interest in resolving the issue and refuse to re-allocate previous payments which were incorrectly applied."

No full institution name, no account number concerning this alleged debt, not contact info and not even a full explanation. I asked for these things after making them aware that I did not receive any 30 day notice from any organization that I had a debt that would be put in collections, I also verbalized that this debt is definitely some misunderstanding because I bought this motorcycle completely wrecked and I notified the tags/title agency of the explanation as to why it was therefore under fair market value. The woman was rude and uncooperative and threatened that this would be placed on my credit report as a delinquent account. I advised her that the debt was over 7 years old and that she was not allowed to do that ... that in fact the debt is over 10 years old. I told her that I was going to have to file a complaint and possible judgement and she told me that there was no statute of limitations and that my credit report would reflect the delinquent account. I then called back in an hour and spoke to XXXX who was equally as rude, yelled at me and spoke over me while I was trying to obtain information to contact the debtor, I got nowhere with this agency and was threatened the entire time.

Long story short, I 've tried to do a short sale from XXXX XXXX before stopping payments due to XXXX and no renter in the house. WF home preservation has the keys to the house since XXXX XXXX and did n't fix the fence that fell down in a storm in XXXX. I now have at least XXXX court judgments against me due to this. 
The inspectors wo n't go to look over the house since I 'm not there to let them in and do n't even have the key. Thus, I have '' failed to complete the Deid in Lueu process ''. I have complained to the Office of the President and their records only show I have n't done what I need to do. I have asked for the recordings to prove what I 've said is true and they said I need a subpoena since they are their property. 
I contacted XXXX XXXX 2 times and talked to different guys, but they said that is outside their scope and referred me to HUD. They ca n't help and said I need to file a complaint with you and find an attorney. 
The best part, on XXXX ( 90 days after retirement exactly ) they send me a letter stating they are going to start foreclosure if I do n't pay my delinquency. 
I do n't know what they gained from this other than the house appreciating, but they have intentionally been dragging me and my family through this nightmare for years to avoid SCRA rules. 
I need help and need it by XXXX XXXX, XXXX please."

I have sent this information to another agency who is trying to collect on the debt, each time I call to verify it 's been taken care of and collection attempts to stop, I keep getting information that is incorrect. The original debt collection agency was XXXX XXXX. I was told on more than one occasion that they could not give me any information because it was archived and they gave me other phone numbers to call. One was the original credit card company and when I called their number the recording stated that they were not taking calls at this time. This was on a Thursday, before XXXX CST. Finally I was able to get in touch with their dispute department, via internet and email, I did get a response that the debt was paid in full along with the account number.

599669,Mortgage,"Drop Mortgage has failed to provide a payment location and amount for a recent loan. This is on top of a disastrous loan process, coupled with shifting data and what can only be described as fraudulent practices at best. 

Their organization is among the most incompetent I have ever had the misfortune of working with. The front end loan folks do n't know what they need for underwriting compliance - even when you use a broker. Across the board everyone I spoke with claimed to be XXXX XXXX compliant. I pressed them for answers about what parts of XXXX they are compliant with, what did they do that was XXXX. They spew these terms without knowing any of the underlying requirements, deadlines, or documentation standards. 

When pressed they make up random answers about delays, new random pieces of paper they mysteriously need after the deadlines, and pick an accuse of the day. That is if you can get them to commit to a date to begin with, XXXX yeah right they sent me a "" post consummation CD '' with a note stating "" you do n't need to sign this we just wanted to let you know now that you have signed that everything changed BY more than {$30000.00}. I seriously had them tell me my docs would be ready in the morning for over 20 days, they even demanded me to cancel using XXXX because they were done ... only to not be done. 

Even after several layers of management, I was unable to find anyone that could give me a straight answer. In 20 plus years of buying / selling property I have never come across a more inept lending organization. 

Please for your own sake and that of your potential property do not use these clowns."

We have never put our mother in laws name on any bills that we have. She was hysterical believing that this would happen over our bill to her. She gave me the following telephone number XXXX which I called finding out the company 's name is Diversified Consultants. I asked them why they would call an individual who is not on our account and disclose personal information at which time I was told that the individual responsible would be reprimanded and that the phone number was taken off of the account. I asked them how they got her telephone number in the first place since she is never on our bills at which time I was told that the individual may have looked at different phone numbers to find a family member. I was then asked if I wanted to take care of the past due amount where I flatly answered no."

677811,Mortgage,"I am writing this letter to inform you of my family 's treatment by Bank of America during our recent mortgage process. This was our first experience as a potentially new customer with BOA and the result was an humiliating experience. It illustrated a lack of sensitivity and understanding by BOA of HIPPA laws, the XXXX Act, Social Security regulations, ECOA, Fair Housing Act and CFPB banking Standards. We feel that we were treated differently than XXXX mortgage applicants. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2014, we applied for a VA Loan through a wonderful and professional local BOA Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX XXXX. She guided us smoothly through the application and loan process. We provided everything that BOA required in a prompt manner. Less than 4 days to our closing date, BOA 's mortgage department notified us via email that our loan approval could be jeopardized by a Social Security income verification requirement. BOA required us to provide medical proof of the permanency of the XXXX of my daughter from the Social Security Administration. We had previously provided BOA with the SS Award Letter. In addition, my wife and I had also provided a detailed personal letter, dated XXXX XXXX 2014, regarding the medical aspect of our purchase of this home. We relayed this requested information to the local SS office, which stated that they did not provide such a letter. In an attempt to find another way to provide this information, we researched the matter and came across information published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that greatly concerned us. We uploaded and emailed BOA 's Mortgage, the CFPB Bulletin XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2014 that clearly prohibit this type of disparate and burdensome verification. You would think that the matter would be resolved. No!! The following day, sitting with our local Mortgage Officer, XXXX XXXX with the BOA underwriter on the phone, XXXX XXXX relayed verbatim from the underwriter that our loan approval required that we provide medical proof of the permanency of XXXX and continuation of SS benefits for 3 years. We explained the SS response and asked XXXX XXXX to put the BOA underwriter on speakerphone. The underwriter refused to speak with us. The conversation ended with XXXX XXXX clearly restating the underwriters requirement of medical proof of the permanency of the XXXX before the loan would be approved. There was no misinterpreting the conversation. 

We left the office visibly upset and alarmed by the uncompromising position of BOA in the face of clear regulatory guidance. This was only 3 days until our scheduled closing, with our house packed, significant financial outlays, moving expenses, insurance and utilities in place and the seller stuck in limbo. Most egregious was how BOA purposely disregarded the CFPB Bulletin with no way to provide proof from SS besides the Award Letter. We were stressed, disappointed and angry!! At this point we realized that we were facing discrimination based on XXXX. BOA underwriting compromised my daughter 's personal and medical privacy by demanding we send sensitive health records in order to approve the loan. It was only after we uploaded these records to BOA and emailed XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX that our loan was approved. We have clear documentation and emails that proves and support our allegations. 

As a XXXX XXXX XXXX Veteran and father of a daughter with permanent XXXX, we were subjected to a loan process that clearly undermined our medical privacy and rights to buy a house without undue burden. The issue that continues to hurt us greatly, is that our request for medical privacy regarding our daughter 's XXXX was ignored by BOA. Her medical records now reside in your database and the email accounts of several BOA employees. Why were we subjected to this?"

However, without another word from XXXX, they sent it to a collection agency, RPM. 
RPM have been calling my phone and home phone 4 to 6 times a day. I contacted them XXXX/XXXX/16, to see who this company was. And why they continue contacting me. That is when I found out, it was over XXXX. I told the lady, I had not received another invoice from XXXX or even from them. She stated they mailed it and would mail another. I informed, again, I had not received notice from XXXX or them. She said they sent a notice on XXXX and that is all that is required. I informed her to stop calling and send my notice. She refused and hung-up on me.I can pull phone records to show the number of calls, I have received. RPM have made 4-6 calls daily for a couple weeks.

I explained to him my concern which was the credit collection report and improper notification & verification of this account. I told him I wanted to pay the account for the full balance due and have this removed because I was not properly notified. He furthered explained to me that the account was still owned by Jefferson Capital Systems, however, it was sent off to a 4th party collection agency and I would have to pay them. I then go into further detail about the issue now and explained that I did not feel comfortable paying another agency for collection owed to them.

434525,Mortgage,"My complaint is against : ( XXXX ) XXXX whose principal office is located at XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Minnesota XXXX ; and ( XXXX ) Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC whose principal office is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a a residential home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Texas ( "" Residence '' ) and signed a "" Home Equity Adjustable Rate Note '' with XXXX XXXX Mortgage Corporation ( "" XXXX XXXX '' ) to fund the sale. XXXX should have placed us in a conventional loan but put us in a home equity loan to illegally get higher fees. Additionally, XXXX refused to provide an accounting after we discovered its fraud. I made several inquiries about the accounting irregularities on this account but never received the full accounting from XXXX, which filed for bankruptcy protection on XX/XX/XXXX. 

After filing bankruptcy, XXXX XXXX sold my note to XXXX XXXX, which also failed to provide any accounting whatsoever, and it declared bankruptcy in late XX/XX/XXXX. After XXXX XXXX filed for bankruptcy protection, I received several letters from different lender/servicers claiming to be the successors-in-interest to XXXX XXXX, including XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

At this point, I was unsure which lender was the legal successor-in-interest and demanded that these companies provide me with ( XXXX ) an adequate RESPA accounting ; and ( XXXX ) proof that it was the legal successor-in-interest to the Note. No company provided either the accounting or proof of legal succession, so I had no idea who to pay. When investigating the legal succession, I discovered that my note was run through the MERS transfer transaction system and that my note was illegal assigned between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

I filed suit against the alleged legal successor to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, called "" XXXX, not in its individual capacity, but solely as trustee for XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX '' ( "" XXXX XXXX '' ) and settled this case for {$300000.00} even though it provided no proof that it was the legal successor to XXXX XXXX and/or any of the alleged predecessors in title, nor any accounting. 

I attempted to fund the settlement agreement by refinancing the home but discovered banking underwriters would not refinance the note despite my excellent credit, good income, and good equity in the home. The reason the underwriters would not refinance the note was because XXXX originated the note as an illegal home equity loan, rather than a conventional loan. The underwriters explained that since I did not own the home, the home equity loan was illegal and therefore potentially void. As such, a successor home equity loan would also be potentially void as well. Thus, no underwriter would refinance the loan. 

Despite not being able to refinance the note, I was able to raise the money in cash and placed the full amount in escrow to fund the settlement. I gave XXXX XXXX proof of funds, but it refused to take my money and instead foreclosed on the property which was worth about {$650000.00} - {$700000.00}. I was forced to move out of my home and now seeking assistance from the CFBP to recover the home. 

I am filing this separate complaint against the servicer, Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC ( and XXXX XXXX ) since they signed and breached the settlement agreement."

384300,Bank account or service,"This has happened many times both to me and Bank of America customers -- $ XXXX {$40.00} overdraft charges. I have first written the Florida Attorney General 's office. XXXX XXXX directs me your way. Below is the entire request -- what happened, desired resolution, etc. A global problem for all B of A customers. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. Here 's the full petition : From : XXXX XXXX [ XXXX : XXXXXXXXXXXX ] Sent : Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, 2015 XXXXTo : 'CFO XXXX XXXX : RE : Bank Overdraft ChargesXXXX, I, like millions of others signed on to Bank of America 's encyclopedia of terms and conditions as a precondition to establishing our mutually beneficial financial relationship, agreeing to pay {$35.00} for every overdraft. Yet so many people simply do not use banks because they do n't eat for the month if they incur a couple overdraft fees. [ Do n't let me get diverted railing at yet deeper bottom feeders such as XXXX. ] My latest situation : an overlooked doctor bill payment of {$48.00} and a check to a friend for a concert ticket for {$47.00} kicked up XXXX {$35.00} O/D fees, totaling {$70.00}. Promised money arrived late. With worse timing, I could have been hit with another {$35.00} O/D fee if, say I 'd charged another {$2.00} for a XXXX, or my {$5.00} automatic payment to NPR had hit when I was overdrawn. If I do n't make it good in five days, I 'm hit with additional fees of similar magnitude. Bad gamble, yes. 
How much does it cost the bank to cover my XXXX checks for three days? Let 's assume they must pay 30 % interest as cost of funds to make my checks good. That 's less than 0.1 % a day. Of course it 's a preposterously high assumed rate. On my deposits I 'm credited nothing, or maybe 0.1 % if I keep a {$3000.00} average balance. Back to their in fact totally nominal interest cost for fronting me, but sticking with the preposterous 30 % interest assumption. On a {$100.00} overdraft, that 's under XXXX cents a day ( = XXXX XXXX 30.00 % / XXXX ). For three day it 's XXXX cents, more like a quarter. The bank collects {$70.00} from me, a return of over XXXX investment. Sure, some customers never make B of A whole. Very few ; they need the checking account to operate their lives, so the vast majority repay. 
Now focus on me -- I auto deposit $ XXXX every month to my checking account, year over year. Pensions. I have had a B of A account for 10+ years. The bank 's risk of getting stiffed by customers such as me is next to nil. The labor and expense of executing an overdraft charge is nil -- the computer system does it automatically. 
The banks ' rationale is "" All the other banks charge the same, even more, {$37.00}, XXXX, XXXX -- it 's a competitive market level amount we charge. You should manage your money prudently. Plus you agreed to it, we disclosed it upfront, so where 's your rip? "" There exists an extremely simple solution that would cost the bank nearly nothing in the line of risk/getting stiffed, yet eliminate surely 80 % of overdraft fees incurred -- offer a two-day grace period, capped at {$200.00} to cover modest debits. Why did not our US Congress include something similar in its reforms of a few years back? Did the banks ' lobbyists persuade Congressmen they could not survive without continuing and perpetual rivers of overdraft revenue? 
If their overdraft fees are fairly set, why will they not disclose to customers and investors this source of earnings amid their aggregate profits ; why will they not disclose the revenue less expense elements that define the bottom line of this profit center? 
Where is the XXXX analyst who will take up the cudgel for all us marginal consumers who are buttressing the banks ' obeisance to their shareholders? And bailing out their colossal mortgage sins and fines from recent years ' misadventures with XXXX XXXX? Is it you?"

XXXX became insolvent and was purchased by XXXX. My original loan paperwork stated that there could be no changed to the original document without my permission. XXXX unilaterally implemented escrow for taxes on top of my principal increasing the total amount by XXXX %. I disputed their authority to do this and continued to pay the originally agreed on principal shown on the mortgage. Several time XXXX returned my personal checks stating they could not accept personal checks. After a while I had my bank issue the payments since XXXX would not record receipt of my checks. For several months they continued to refuse accepting payments from my bank. I had to retain counsel to settle their claims but they did not notify the credit agencies to remove the negative comments they had submitted. One would think that XXXX would not have wanted my account if I were such a bad credit risk but they did BUT they "" forgave the debt '' i.e. the months they did not accept premium payments and rewrote a new agreement including the "" forgiven debt '' into the new agreement. Watch out when XXXX "" forgives the debt '' because they notify the IRS and the IRS considers that as income which you will be taxed on. It cost me about {$30000.00} in legal fees to dispute XXXX plus the law firm I used did not advise me that there would be a tax consequence if a debt is forgiven. If I would have known that then I would have told my law firm to negotiate a better deal. Their forgiving the debt cost me another {$10000.00} due to the IRS so overall it cost me {$40000.00} because XXXX did n't honor the original loan documents."
484062,Debt collection,"When you rent from these apartments, the manager will be your real estate broker. 

Regarding the BAD MANAGEMENT of these apartments, at an apartment complex build and managed by the same company that is building and managing XXXX It appears as though management lied about the amenities that they offered such being a tanning bed and garages. It appears as though management and or other personnel of the apartments did willfully and intentionally alter our lease contract by extending the end date of the contract by one month without our knowledge and approval. It appears as though management and or other personnel photographed themselves as they vandalized the carpet in the apartment that we rented and vacated at the apartments. After vacating said apartment, we hired an apartment cleaning service to clean said apartment, and we hired a carpet cleaning service to clean said carpet. After management and maintenance personnel from the apartments examined and approved the condition and cleanliness of said apartment, it appears as though management and or other personnel at the apartments photographed themselves as they intentionally forced a finger between the seams of the carpet and ripped the seams apart. The management and or other personnel then blamed me for ripping the carpet seams apart and billed me for the replacement of the entire said carpet in the apartment and violating the end date of said lease. 
The same may happen to you. 
During construction you will eat dirt and your car will be covered with dirt. You will constantly head the sound of builders and machinery, and the amenities they promised you will either never be there of be built a year or more later. 
They are petty and rude and have a relationship with a collection agency that will submit your name and social security number to XXXX and other credit bureaus on management 's request. 
If you rent there you will be renting from fly by night builders that build apartment complexes sell them and leave town. 
Watch out for the mold, leaks, thin floors and walls and a manager that is a mean realtor. 
Fraud is the intentional use of deceit, a trick or some dishonest means to deprive another of his or her or its money, property or a legal right. A party who has lost something due to fraud is entitled to file a lawsuit for damages against the party acting fraudulently, and the damages may include punitive damages as a punishment or public example due to the malicious nature of the fraud. Quite often there are several persons involved in a scheme to commit fraud and each and all may be liable for the total damages. Inherent in fraud is an unjust advantage over another which injures that person or entity. It includes failing to point out a known mistake in a contract. There is a known mistake in a contract that was never pointed out to me by my broker. It also includes failing to not reveal a fact which he or she has a duty to communicate, such as not delivering promised amenities. My broker promised amenities including a tanning bed and garages as originally understood. The amenities of a tanning bed and garages were not delivered to me as promised. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty such as lying about advertising amenities that were not delivered. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty without direct proof of fraud or fraudulent intent. Extrinsic fraud occurs when deceit is employed to keep someone from exercising a right, such as a fair trial, by hiding evidence or misleading the opposing party in a lawsuit."

713857,Mortgage,"I am sending this email to file a complaint about Roundpoint Mortgage persistent negligence in not following up with their customer concerns, lack of knowledge of the customer service reps, and XXXX poor customer service. I received an escrow analysis statement the first week of XXXX indicating my new mortgage payment was going to increase by approximately XXXX month. I contacted RPM TWICE to get an understanding of the escrow analysis and was instructed to send in copies of our tax statements and I also included a copy of our updated appraisal. I immediately faxed as well as emailed the requested documentation so that the re-analysis would be initiated. I was told by XXXX of the customer reps that a re-analysis of the escrow would be done. I also requested to speak with supervisor during BOTH calls because I was not getting an understanding of the analysis and how they came up with the amount indicating the need of an increase of XXXX month. I never received any calls from RPM in reference to my questions. I called on XXXX/XXXX/16 to get an update on the re-analysis and was told it would be completed by XXXX/XXXX/16. I called today ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ) and spoke with XXXX different reps. The first rep was not able to answer any questions in regards to the re-analysis, so I requested a supervisor. I was transferred to a female representative and she immediately proceeds to tell me that I have "" utility lien '' on my house. After questioning her about this so called "" utility lien '', I had to tell this rep that she was reading our tax statement for our utility district. After speaking for 10 minutes back and forth about our escrow, she proceeds to let us know that no re-analysis was completed. After further speaking with this representative she proceeds to let me know that a 2 month cushion was required in our escrow account totaling approximately {$50000.00}, which is insane. I was under the impression that she was supervisor, but after speaking with her and realizing she did not know how to answer the questions she admitted to not being a supervisor and stated that she was told we requested a U.S. rep. 

The issue at this point is the escrow re-analysis was never done and I require assistance in getting my mortgage payment lowered. My family ca n't afford to pay XXXX month from {$2300.00} a month. This increase in my payment amount is RIDICULOUS and there is no way that a mortgage payment should increase more than XXXX month each year. I am requesting the assistance of management to look over my account and contact me to discuss options and also to ensure that the figures are correct. My account information is listed below :"
212264,Mortgage,"I am filing another complaint on behalf of my client. After my last complaint regarding the manner in which my client 's loan modification application was reviewed, XXXX different Wells Fargo representatives contacted me from the Executive Office ( XXXX and XXXX ). After speaking to them and my client I told them that my client wanted to forgo the loan modification review and instead be reviewed for a short sale. I asked XXXX if that was possible. She said it was but that the review had to be expedited. I agreed. I told her that we had secured an offer for the property and that we could send it over immediately. I stressed to her that because a sale date had been set for XXXX XXXX that it was IMPERATIVE that someone contact me ASAP to review the file. I told her I did not want to delay ONLY to be told that we were too close to the new Trustee Sale date. She assured me that the review would be expedited that and someone from the executive short sale department would be contacting me. It has been nearly a week and no one has contacted my office. My assistant calls Wells Fargo 3 times a day trying to get in touch with someone. We have not heard from XXXX or anyone else. Customer Service does not seem to know what is going on. I am concerned and believe that time is going to fly by until we are once again close to a sale date. As I was writing this my assistant just spoke to someone that said the offer is being reviewed but they have not asked for anything NOR do we have a representative to discuss the matter with. 
I have always worked well with Wells Fargo so I am VERY confused by this. We are trying to resolve this matter amicably and avoid a foreclosure sale. The offer that we received is a good offer especially considering the condition of the property. I do not know what value Wells Fargo has for the property but an INTERIOR BPO is needed. Trust me, Wells Fargo needs to get someone inside this home to check out what is going on. 
I am only resorting to communicating through the CFPB because Wells Fargo will not return our calls. 
I want to believe that Wells Fargo is working in good faith but the run around that we get from customer service tells me otherwise. I do not trust what is going on right now. My client is willing to do whatever it takes to resolve this matter FAST. 
I have a funny feeling that time is going to pass and I am going to be given some XXXX excuse. I am documenting all of our calls and attempts to work with Wells Fargo. 
Please have someone contact me ASAP at XXXX to discuss this situation. Time is of the essence."

I informed the agent that I will go ahead and settle this debt in full so that the account will be deleted off my credit reports and also since i did not receive any notice of debt verification and also it is not my fault for not settling this debt on time.

286519,Credit card,"Hello, XX/XX/XXXX applied for and received a Barclaycard Mastercard as part of an effort to rebuild my credit. As is the case with folks with less than perfect credit, the card had an exceptionally high interest rate and onerous fees for everything. Right off the bat there were issues with access my account, viewing statements, but I paid as I spent, and my limit was only {$2000.00}. 
At one point XX/XX/XXXX, I was nearly at my limit. I paid a minimum payment, and then set up my bank to pay automatically, and I put the card away. Somehow the minimum payments just seemed increase despite the fact that I was not spending on the card. I did n't notice this for some time because I did n't think they would increase if I had n't spent. 
Then the calls came, multiple times a day, disrupting me at work. Half the time no one was on the line. They called when payment was due, the same day I made a payment, the day after, and I got emails telling me I was near my limit, thanking me for my payment, telling me my statement was ready. Each month the minimum payment was climbing by $ XXXX+. I could n't pay that, and I continued with the automatic payments at less. 
XX/XX/XXXX my last statement said my minimum payment was {$700.00} - on {$2000.00} limit card? Then I received a letter that my account had been handed over to a collection agency. No warning. No letter or email or voicemail. Just XX/XX/XXXX statement, and XX/XX/XXXX collection agency. Efforts to talk with them just get me diverted to the collection agency. 
All the work I had done to repair my credit destroyed, and not so much as a warning. I was told making timely payments was most important, even it they were not full amount. 
This has been devastating. It was a terrible decision, and Barclay is a terrible and predatory organization."

Before I left on my trip, I signed up for their autopay program. I was gone for XXXX weeks. When I came home, I noticed that I had a balance from the previous month. I called chase, and the rep told me there are some purchases that do n't qualify for autopay. I had no idea why, but I felt I had no choice to pay the interest. If I had made a mistake not reading some fine print, it was my fault. I called them back and asked the rep to use my bank account to pay off my balance. He said he would take care of everything. My balance and any interest charges I owe would be taken care of. This was 3 months ago. I have since received a couple of hundred dollar charges on every statement received after. When I inquire about it, they tell me they are residual interest charges. Not sure why I 'm paying residual charges when everything should be paid off and I was specifically told by the representative that I would be starting on a clean slate after I paid off my balance. I 've had many credit cards over the last XXXX years. I 've never XXXX paid interest until 3 mouths ago. Very frustrating to deal with their customer service.

They did file Notice of Default with the XXXX XXXX courts in 2010 and even had a sale date that we never notified of. But the continual excuses and dragging the issue around when we asked multiple times in writing for a modification did nothing but leave a huge amount because the original loan was never paid and interest and late charges were mounting. We requested a reduction in principal which many homeowners in XXXX XXXX XXXX received but they finally made a loan mod agreement and never mention that there would be a new servicer for the loan and not XXXX. The servicing company Select Portfolio Services. This company has a track record that goes back to before they were SPS.

738396,Mortgage,"My husband and I had a home equity loan from Sovereign which was a second loan taken out on our home. The loan was taken out with Soverign and they became Santander. We went through a loss of our business and Chapter XXXX bankruptcy which has been released. Originally, we had made our monthly loan payments directly through our checking account with the bank because they required that it was done that way. After we went into bankruptcy the bank we were informed by our local branch that they would no longer allow us to make payments directly through our account. They did not give us any direction as to how and where we should continue to make these loan payments. So, we brought our monthly check payment to our local branch. After a year or so, the branch stated they could no longer take the monthly loan payments directly. We spoke with the branch manager at that time and we wanted to know why this was no longer allowed. He told us he would "" look into it '' and later informed us that it was because of our bankruptcy but we could drop off the check at the branch and they would foward it to the appropriate office. Once we declared bankruptcy, we no longer received monthly loan apyment notices or other information on our existing loan, payments that we made, or loan balances. Since the bankruptcy was discharged in XXXX, we still have not received any information on our payments or loan balances. We do not even know how much we have left to pay or even what our account number is. All of our efforts to go through the numerous different branch managers to find out what was going on have failed. We continue to make payments through the local branch office but only get a handwritten receipt from the bank teller that acknowledges our check payment ( without any account number on it ). This has become so ridiculous but we can not get a straight answer about our loan! The other problem we are encountering is that when we leave our check with the local branch, we never know when it will be cashed. Some months it is in 3-4 days and other months ( like the last XXXX XXXX payment ) it was not cashed for weeks. This has caused us to get into an overdraw situation with our checking account ( from another Credit union ) and we end up paying expensive overdraw fees. We need to get the information on our loan, what we owe, where we should be sending payments, and when they are due and expected to be cashed ( not to mention an account number and documentation of payments received ). 
Please let us know if we can get help with this."

309445,Credit reporting,"I was trying to get my credit reports from all XXXX reporting companies via XXXX. When I got to the Equifax site, I was asked a security question that related to how much the required payment was for a specific account and I gave the wrong answer. The problem is that the account happens to be a home equity line of credit, and we had just written another check, so the number changed recently. It seems rather stupid to ask questions like that about accounts where the monthly payment can vary. The real problem is that once you get the security question wrong a XXXX time, you are told to send sensitive documents via the USPS in order to request your report. There should be a way to upload required documents to a secure site. At the very least there should be a phone number to call so that you can request your report via the phone, or speak to a person about why you are having a problem. What would have happened if the account that I was being questioned about happened to be fraudulent? - I would have no clue how to answer the question and then would experience a delay in getting my report, possibly allowing time for more fraudulent accounts to be opened. The XXXX companies should be required to provide a phone number or computer chat capability at the point where they prevent you from accessing your own credit report to prevent delays."

I had a lot of problems with them when I was a customer so naturally I wanted to check to make sure my credit reflected correct information. I was advised if already pulled credit report from annual credit report.com and still wanted a copy that we were entitled to one from XXXX and could request it by calling UAC. I did that in on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and spoke with a woman who had no idea what was going on but took my request to the credit department and was told would mail it and they took my new address. That was two months ago and I have yet to receive any credit report from them. I then called UAC today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and spoke to a XXXX XXXX who was incredibly rude he must have interrupted me 5 times during the conversation and was very argumentative. He had the nerve to tell me that it did n't really apply to me because I have n't done business with them in two years when the email I got about it in XX/XX/XXXX which provided additional information specifically said that it involved accounts that were before XX/XX/XXXX so it definatly concerned me. Then when I basically told him to stop arguing with me and put in my request he took down my new address and married name and said would request my credit report. Then a little while later he called me back to tell me that I was wrong and that they are not sending customer 's credit reports but that is what it says in both emails that I received I was treated with incredible rudeness by this customer service representative ony to have him back off multiple times and say he 's just trying to help me I want to know that my information is correct and I want it taken care of as stated by UAC I have not been a customer of theirs for awhile and I would never be again. Every conversation I ever had with those people the whole time I had a loan was disgusting rudeness I was given a loan modification once to help me out and they failed to let me know at the modifcatin that they were raising my interest rate I think they raised it to like a disgusting 24 or 29 % I had a terrible experience with this company and to call back later with a fully paid off account only to be treated like XXXX again is truly annoying.

110378,Prepaid card,"I was charged a {$2.00} per month service fee which I believe is illegal under Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 ( H.R. 627 ). 

Title IV on gift cards : '' it shall be unlawful for any person to impose a ... service fee ... with respect to ... general-use prepaid card '' Exceptions : a ) The fee starts *seven months* from issuance therefore it does not meet that exception. 
b ) disclosure requirements are met ( see below ) c ) N/a ( there is only one fee per month ) d ) I will refer to Bureau experts on additional rule-makings ( 3 ) Disclosure req. 
a ) Clearly and conspicuously states : ( i ) that a fee may be charged - this is *not clear nor conspicuous* as the only place it was mentioned was in the verbiage of the terms sheet which no consumer reads and on the back of the card ... so I had no reason to look for it until I checked my balance. 

( ii ) the amount of the charge - this is clearly listed on the back of the charge but it is *definitely not conspicuous* especially when I was aware that charges on prepaid cards are illegal I expected extra-ordinary notice with references to these exceptions. 

( iii ) how often such a fee may be issued - the term on the boiler plate of the back of the card states "" monthly '' I do not know if that meets the specificity requirements here. 

( iv ) *** The term does not list this as an inactivity fee just a service charge but that is exactly what this is. 

( B ) "" the issuer or vendor of such certificate or card informs the purchaser of such charge or fee before such certificate or card is purchased, *regardless of whether the certificate or card is purchased in person, over the Internet, or by telephone. * '' I was not made aware of these fees before I received these cards from rebates. Moreover, given the media attention this act received the default position is that there are no fees so any fees need to receive explicit notice ( s ) in order to be clear and conspicuous given the context. 

I spoke with Supervisor XXXX of the Rewards Team Ext : XXXX who even after I explained why these terms are illegitimate said they would not reverse the XXXX {$2.00} charges as a response to the law or as a courtesy due to the terms and conditions. 

These sort of fees which fly in the face of the spirit of the regulations in place to protect consumers also violate the letter by not informing recipients before they receive the card and not clearly and conspicuously stating terms. As I 'm sure many people go by the expiration date and when they go to use their card it is declined for insufficient balance and they find themselves with less than half there expected balance. 

Currently the back of the card tells you to go to americanexpress.com/reward or call customer service. And the website tells you to call customer service number listed on the card. This is classic diversion and time wasting tactics to keep consumers ill informed. 

This deceitful practice grants American Express and and other prepaid company a windfall of XXXX dollars in the form of {$2.00} per month charges times up to 6 years. 

The CFPB needs to be strict on these cases because it is not worth disputing {$2.00} at a time for the consumer but millions are being stolen this way."

I did not agree to be in repayment, I had no idea they had put me in repayment.

I made a payment of {$25.00} as scheduled XX/XX/XXXX and it left me a remaining balance of XXXX {$27.00}. The rep advised me that I had a balance of XXXX {$90.00}.

I advised the rep that I had not received any statements from their company. I offered to take care of {$27.00} to resolve the balance with the request to have XXXX late fees waived as a sign of goodwill as I had expressed that I never received my bills PLUS the LATE FEE IS MORE THAN MY BALANCE OWED. The representative stated that they were only able to waive XXXX Late Fee per year and they would offer me the waiver in exchange of me paying the {$27.00} + XXXX {$25.00} Late Fee. I advised that was not fair or reasonable and that I needed both fees waived. The rep said no and then I requested to speak with a supervisor. I spoke with a supervisor who advised me the same thing. I expressed once again about the fairness to consumer. I requested to speak with someone higher and was advised no there would grant my request for a 2 month fee waiver. 

2nd Call : Inbound XX/XX/2015I made a XXXX attempt ( XXXX ) to have my issue resolved regarding the late fees and to pay on the account. I explained to the rep my issue again and noticed that my balance due amount changed slightly. I asked for a breakdown of my amount once again and was advised .... {$27.00} remaining from purchase - {$38.00} late fee for XX/XX/XXXX ( which the rep proactively waived on my 1st call ) + {$25.00} late fee for XX/XX/XXXX + ... {$38.00} late fee for XX/XX/XXXX ( since my dd was on XX/XX/XXXX )!!

Now, I am highly upset and stated that I will contact the CFPB, XXXX, and the AG Office. I advised the rep that I need to speak to someone else and she stated that I already spoke to the supervisor which would not approve it.

3rd Call : Inbound XX/XX/2015I made a 3rd attempt to get this issue by contacting the Account Specialist group at XXXX and behold I got the same rep that spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX call as she reminded me. She recapped the notes and stated that the information still stood about me not receiving a XXXX late fee waivers but now since one Late Fee was waived ( without my approval ) now I ca n't receive an additional waiver. I asked to speak to the supervisor of her supervisor and she stated she will try to see if they will come to the phone. I advised the rep that I am completely fed up and that I will be contacting regulatory agencies. She placed me on hold and I hung up. 

Key points : Charged late fee ( s ) greater than the amount of my remaining balance of purchase {$38.00} late fee waived without my approval ( review call ) I was never advised to make a payment or any payment as my due date was on XX/XX/XXXX to avoid another late fee ( review notes ) No calls to notify me of my delinquency until I accumulated & gt ; {$60.00} worth of late fees ... guess what, if I was contacted by Macys the 1st day I was past due ... low and behold I would be current as I would had paid the {$27.00} and had the late fee waived No escalation process for the consumer to get situation resolved"

391398,Credit card,"I had a preferred checking line of credit ( XXXX ) thru Key Bank that functioned as either a credit card or cash loan. Due to medical expenses my limit was reached on this account. Key Bank customer service advised that I could open a Key Bank Platinum Card ( XXXX ) and transfer the previous balance to the new card at a lower interest rate. This was due to the increasing interest rate on the original card that made it difficult to keep up with payments.. The transfer would lower the interest rate. At this juncture I was expecting the original amount on the first card to be transferred to the new Platinum Card at a lower rate, then they dropped a bomb on me and advised that I could not transfer the balance to the new card. I advised them that I was unemployed at the time the new card was opened. And soon after the second card was opened, Key Bank began to raise the rate from 7.9 % to near 20 %. I kept falling behind and was unable to establish a payment program, the card rates were increasing and the penalties and interest made it impossible to repay the debt. I have since contacted them several times and offered to close the credit card accounts and convert the debt to a consumer loan in order to pay it back. They have refused all options to repay them and continue to charge me penalties. I now have little hope of ever paying this loan back unless they cooperate and realize that their manipulation, failure to close the first card, and charging me higher and higher interest with penalties has put me in this situation. 

The Bank was applying all my payments toward the finance charges and penalties and NOT the principal. This made it impossible to pay this amount off!"

XXXX XXXX XXXX told me that they did n't have more information on this other than providing me with a phone number listed in this Legal Order ( I can not even view this information on my only bank account ) that forced XXXX to take money out of my bank account and give it to another party. XXXX gave me the phone number of the Connecticut 's XXXX XXXX Office XXXX. The number they gave me was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I then called the CT XXXX Office. I was told by the XXXX Office that they issued the Legal Order on behalf of the debt collecting law firm XXXX XXXX XXXX and that XXXX XXXX XXXX is representing Portfolio Recovery Associates -- a private debt collection firm. My personal name was cleared of any possible wrongdoing in this case that led to the debt collection but I was told by the XXXX Office that the Legal Order was served on my mother -- whose name was on my bank account up until more than a year ago. The XXXX Office also told me that apparently monthly payments of {$35.00} XXXX for what service or product they do not know ) had not been paid and as such, over the months and years, the penalties increased to {$1400.00}. I was also told that I can fill out an exemption form ( CT form XXXX ) to have the money returned to my bank account and have my mom work out a payment arrangement with the debt collection agency. The XXXX Office proceeded to give me the phone number of XXXX XXXX XXXX -- the law firm. 

Before I called XXXX XXXX XXXX, I called my mother to ask her if she has been receiving anything from any debt collection agency or the law firm XXXX XXXX XXXX. She told me that she has not been receiving anything from either of those entities. She also has not even been aware of any outstanding debt under her name. And indeed, I can concur with her statements because I live in the same house as her and I have not seen any legal notice or anything from either of these two entities either. 

I called XXXX XXXX XXXX somewhere around XXXX today and was told that the I can not speak to them about the case unless my mom speaks to them ( since, they said, this was my mom 's case after all ) and gives them permission to speak to me on her behalf ( my mother can not speak XXXX very well ). The representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX told me that I had until XXXX to call him back today. I called him back at around XXXX today and was told by the office voicemail that the office has been closed at XXXX. This is starting to sound like it is outside the bounds of legality and I am starting to get suspicious. 

I want to emphasize that neither my mother or I were served any legal notice or bill in regards to this mysterious amount of {$1400.00} or anything requiring me or her to pay {$35.00} per month. We received nothing in the mail and nothing via email either."
445820,Student loan,"Every time I call Navient, I get a different story and a different answer. I will call and be told that my loans are current and there are no issues, then the next thing I know they are saying that I am past due. I make {$1900.00} per month and most of that goes towards raising my family of XXXX. They say that my lowest monthly payment is around {$300.00} which is too high for me. When I call they give me attitude and never seem to record what was said during the previous call. I have a very hard time even getting ahold of somebody. I am often on hold for 45 min. I called to re enroll in the lower monthly plan and they said they needed my main borrower 's financial information because it had n't been updated since 2014. How is that possible when I have been in rate reduction this year? They make no sense what so ever."
732879,Mortgage,"Crux of issue : XXXX calliber did not receive my proof of insurance. Somehow XXXX years later they assessed {$4000.00} to my escrow and evoked a payment though my insurance company. Escrow ballooned and so did payment..not to my knowledge. Additionally Caliber did an inaccurate tax forecast that ultimately needed to be corrected that contributed additionally to the inflated monthly payment. When I was able to connect with Caliber Customer service ( they had called several times but left NO messages ) It took XXXX calls and XXXX days for customer service to clearly state what the issue was. Reps who said they would call back never did. Their esrow department could not explain why there was huge spike in escrow, each representative had a different story. Ultimately Caliber held my on-time payments, did not post them to my account and did not return my checks to me ... and most importantly they did not apply my payments to my account. For the two months ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that this was being resolved they reported me late 30 days. I called and wrote them to review, I also disputed through XXXX. They denied my requests to remove the XXXX 30 day lates from my credit report. 


XXXX I contI was told by customer service that XXXX said that because it was reported late in the system she can not change it. Seems unreasonable Other - Payment was made on time ... caliber help my $ $ 's and did not return them"

Nationstar told me they are legally prohibited from reporting my info for 60 days following the loan transfer.

After repeated attempts to contact Amazon, I was finally able to actually talk to someone and they referred me to their attorney. I called the attorney 's office and was requested to submit a signed statement to them in writing that I would not dispute the account in question before they would even talk to me about the account. I 'm not about to sign such a statement since this account does not belong to me. Even though I was finally able to talk to a representative at Amazon, I have not been able to find out any further information regarding this account. Since this account is being reported on my credit as a charged off account, it is negatively affecting my credit score and my ability to obtain credit. Thank you."
664678,Student loan,"I 've been working in the XXXX profession for the past 5.5 years and have regularly been making payments on my student loans. I submitted the paperwork for Public Service Loan Forgiveness and learned, to my dismay, that none of the previous years worth of payments counted towards my loan forgiveness. This was understandably a blow because I was never made to understand that only certain repayment plans qualify. Given that a lot of time and money went into paying my loans in full and on time I think at least a portion of those payments should count toward my Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Unfortunately when I called FedLoan Servicing to inquire about this they told me there was no appeal process. This left me at a loss and very disheartened. Given that the language in the letter I received stated that "" MOST of your payments must be made ... '' under qualifying repayment plans I think at least a portion of the previous payments made should count towards my forgiveness."

41485,Mortgage,"This complaint is surrounding violations to the Dodd Frank Act of XX/XX/XXXX, the citations to Georgia 's foreclosure statutes and XXXX Code Annotated Sections 44-14-160 through 44-14-191.I 've never been late on my mortgage until this last year and for the first time during the life of my loan, I applied for mortgage payment assistance on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Although I faxed my mortgage servicer Selene Finance ( SF ), a full and complete package. I had even sent SF, a copy of my divorce decree on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, which indicated that my ex-wife had no interest in the property. However, SF persisted that I provide additional documentation regarding this matter. Needless to say I was forced to have the co-borrower complete a quit claim deed for the property before SF, would review my loan assistance application. Due to my divorce and the fact that my ex-wife lives in XXXX, it took a little bit longer than I anticipated for me to acquire the necessary documents that SF, had requested.During this time SF, denied my request on XX/XX/XXXX, citing that I had missed a deadline date which was unbeknownst to me.I requested for an escalation to a manager because of the unfair treatment and the matter was reviewed by supervisor XXXX.To my knowledge the loan was then placed back under review, as of XX/XX/XXXX.On XX/XX/XXXX, we were told by XXXX agent of SF, that my loan was in the second level review for a standard modification agreement. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received both a letter acknowledging that SF received a full package for review and a decline letter dated 5 days later declining my review. The decline letter stated that I had until XX/XX/XXXX, to dispute the decision. According to the Dodd Frank act of XX/XX/XXXX, after a modification review has been completed in particularly after review for HAMP, it is required that I be given a minimal of 30 days in which I have to file an appeal. I did n't receive my denial letter, until after the appeal period had already come and gone. This illegal act further harmed me because it did not allow me due process under the terms of Dodd Frank.We then later discovered that our loan had been referred to foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX, and assigned to a foreclosure attorney by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX. on the same day. 
To this day I have yet to receive a formal demand letter. This Notice is required by State and Federal law to allow me 30 days to respond or dispute the default within the office of XXXX XXXX Esq.. This is also a violation of my due process in every way, therefore no demand letter was received by the foreclosure XXXX XXXX XXXX, prior to this office establishing a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX.Now we 're being told the loan was denied for modification on XX/XX/XXXX and a letter mailed on XX/XX/XXXX. This completely contradicts what we were told by agents of SF, on both XX/XX/XXXX, when we spoke with XXXX and were told that the loan was in second level review for standard loan modification. This act is fraud and misrepresentation of the truth and extremely misleading. 
No later than 30 days prior to the date of the scheduled foreclosure sale, the lender must send the borrower notice of the initiation of proceedings to exercise a power of sale. The notice must be sent via registered mail, certified mail, or overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to the property address or to any other address the borrower has designated by written notice to the lender. XXXX XXXX XXXX, the lender 's attorney also failed to send me a notice informing us that we have ten days from the receipt of such notice to pay the principal and interest without incurring attorneys ' fees. This notice would have given us a 30-day notice of sale.This was not done and these multitude of issues has been abusive and all levels of creditor abuse"
250057,Mortgage,"In the Matter of : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , CA XXXXAccount Number # XXXX XXXX # XXXXXXXXAcc # XXXXCorrespondence Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VA XXXXNationstar Mortgage LLCXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXXHOMEOWNER COMPLAINTThe Home-owner is making this complaint as the Home-owner alleges that the Servicer and bank has caused certain improper mistakes to occur and committed other actions with respect to the title and the rights of the home owner, upon a default. 


NationStar Mortgage LLC filed a Declaration Pursuant to Civil Code 2923.55 ( c ) in which it stated that it has made diligent efforts to offer the home-owner a proper arrangement to avoid foreclosure, when a default occurs. See Exhibit A Declaration of Mortgage Servicer. The Declaration as a condition precedent is not Genuine based on many factors as the servicer did not contact the Home-owner to make any arrangement to avoid foreclosure as is required in this matter. 


The said exhibit is also not genuine as the very signature is a scribble mark by an unknown person who is not properly identified as he executed the document. The printed name of the declaration is illegible, the effect of these mistakes attest to the alleged improper actions of the servicer that the home-owner was not given the chance to avoid this action for such a small amount of money and a relatively young default. 


Specifically the Home Owner Bill of Rights, in part as seen below states : The Homeowner 's Bill of Rights ( Civ.Code, 4 2920.5, 2923.4-.7, 2924, 2924.9- .12, 2924.15, 2924.17-.20 ) ( "" HBOR '' ), effective XXXX XXXX, XXXX, was enacted "" to ensure that, as part of the nonjudicial foreclosure process, borrowers are considered for, and have a meaningful opportunity to obtain, available loss mitigation options, if any, offered by or through the borrower 's mortgage servicer, such as loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. '' ( 2923.4. ) Among other things, HBOR prohibits "" dual tracking, '' which occurs when a bank forecloses on a loan while negotiating with the borrower to avoid foreclosure. ( 2923.6. ) HBOR provides for injunctive relief for statutory violations that occur prior to foreclosure ( 2924.12, subd. ( a ) ), and monetary damages when the borrower seeks relief for violations after the foreclosure sale has occurred. ( 2924.12, subd. 


The Assignment of Deed of Trust filed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX is also defective and therefore is not genuine, for several reasons, at Exhibit B Assignment of Deed of Trust the document being dated XXXX XXXX XXXX was filed with the court many years after the specific trust in which it was assigned too had closed, this is basic California as seen in the XXXX Case. The Document is void and therefore not genuine. 


The Name of the securitized trust is XXXX, AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE FOR XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the trust closed in XXXX. The assignment at Exhibit pro-ports to make a transfer many yesrs after the trust has been closed, the entry is void. The effect of this improper as the home owner alleges it, results in broken chains of title and illegal actions against the homeowner. 


The homeowner has asked the servicers certain question in the form of a QWR. See Exhibit C, QWR."

Furthermore, if my account has an alert on it then the culprit should 've been asked to provide the verbal password. It was not provided. The bank manager was very rude and was not accepting responsibility for their lack of securing my account. I honestly feel like it 's an inside job at this point because they wo n't give me the contact to their regional manager to discuss the issue.

I request on many occasion that this credit bureau validate the allege debts but I have never receive any evidence of verified debt from original source. The credit bureau is supposed to request verifiable proof not partially but in whole according to federal law. The law requires the bureau to only report the negative item if they have XXXX percent verifiable proof in regards to the negative item that they are reporting. The credit bureau is supposed to get the original contract along with other documents from the original creditors and within 30 days provide the information to me.

My bankruptcy attorney was not helpful with disputing this amount and I was so stressed out that I went ahead and entered into a Loan Modification with them and did not dispute the amount. During the bankruptcy and after I have requested monthly statements. My attorney sent several letters telling the it was ok for them to send monthly statements ; and I have called and faxed/mailed letters asking for monthly statements.

720180,Credit reporting,"I reviewed my TransUnion credit report several months after a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy discharge and found numerous errors, so I filed a written dispute via a detailed certified letter. Not only was a lot of my personal information incorrect, the main issue was that the creditor accounts discharged were still noted as delinquent and every trade line contained negative information. Since accounts discharged in bankruptcy are only allowed to reflect this wording and a XXXX balance, and no other negative information can be shown on the account 's trade line, I filed the dispute mainly in regard to the accounts in question. When I received the reply from TransUnion, it was very apparent that no one read my very detailed letter nor did they pay any attention to the meticulous documentation ( my bankruptcy discharge, the creditor matrix and petition ) I enclosed because they did practically nothing to correct the errors in my report. Other than deleting the wrong addresses and some of the incorrect phone numbers listed in the file, nothing else was fixed. They even created a new error by removing my current employer and adding a previous company that I worked for 15 years ago in it 's place! Each of the creditor details were the same and included the very same negative remarks that were there in the first report I reviewed. I spent hours and so much time putting together the package that I initially sent them with notes and back-up documents the first time around to actually have things fixed. I just want it corrected once and for all. I 'm trying to put my life back together. After a bankruptcy, you take the hit by having that public record notation in your file for 10 years. Every trade line in your credit report gets "" Bankruptcy '' added to it, as well, but they do n't get to keep any of the balances, delinquency notes and collection remarks, on top of it. Is n't that why you went down the bankruptcy path in the first place - to wipe those slates clean? So in closing, I just want the errors and delinquency information appearing in the trade lines of my TranUnion report fixed once and for all. I have attached a copy of my dispute letter along with the first credit report I received from TranUnion with all of the errors highlighted, the supporting documentation, and the so-called "" revised '' report I then received from Transunion. Thank you in advance for your time and assistance."
426631,Credit card,"I was forced to carry XXXX mortgages and left with over {$20000.00} in overdue bills and damages when the tenants in my California home disappeared in XXXX 2015. I managed to cover everything, but had to juggle and barely made it. I got the house back on the market and sold, but I was financially in trouble until I received the monies from the close of escrow. I called Discover Card and explained to a representative my situation requesting that I be allowed to hold off one additional month and would pay in full on XXXX XXXX or as soon as the mortgage closed. The representative agreed to allow me to do that and said he would notate it in the billing notes. We had an agreement. At no time did he inform me that Discover would report me to the credit reporting companies, my understanding was, we had an agreement. I was finally able to plan on giving my family the new home I had been promising them for several years. Discover turned me in as late to the credit monitoring agencies and caused a XXXX point drop in my credit rating. I had nothing negative on my credit record prior to this. Nothing! Had I realized they would do this, I would have done everything I could have to prevent it, and in reality, thought I had. I had no idea they would do so, as we had an agreement. I called them. They were much less than concerned, one Discover representative telling me to read the full contract after explaining to her that this has placed and unfair, and in my opinion, extreme hardship on me and my family. I 'm retired. I 'm a XXXX and I do n't understand much of the financial working of credit companies and I 'm just trying to survive. But when I make an agreement, I stand by it. This has caused us to have to spend {$1500.00} to {$2000.00} a month more if I am going to give my family the home they deserve, due to a higher interest bracket and having to pay mortgage insurance, all due to the credit report from Discover Card, and their not honoring their agreement with me. Again, my credit was nearly in the XXXX prior to this. It dropped into the XXXX due to it. I feel Discover Card did not properly honor their agreement with me and I feel they should pull the negative report. Especially as I paid them in full as soon as I got the escrow money, holding up my end of the agreement."

First off a new balance is added to my credit report as a "" New Collection '' instead of updating a current balance. When I have contacted MRN they tell me they are new accounts that are going into collection and they have to report them. 
I only have XXXX accounts with XXXX XXXX Hospital ( See attached documents ) The letter of verification MRN sent me has numerous account # 's and none of these numbers are matched up to my XXXX XXXX XXXX account #. ( Attached are documents ) My accounts # 's are XXXX and XXXX MRN has Different Account # 's on the Verification of accounts all XXXX of them. 
Also I am attaching a Bill MRN says is from XXXX Hospital ( who the debt they are collecting on ) As you see, it says Guarantor account # is one of the numbers with my XXXX account. Which is how my account is setup through XXXX which I verified with the XXXX XXXX. The other discrepancy in this bill is that it is fake, I will find the original bill and show you if needed that XXXX Hospital Billing and accounts are in XXXX Michigan and not XXXX Michigan. This was verified by XXXX XXXX themselves. They do not have any offices in XXXX Michigan. MRN is out of lansing they explained. 
If MRN continues to argue that my accounts are separate and do not remove my collections. I will have to take further legal action and I want to avoid this. 
I was never notified that MRN was going to collect on these debts, I was only notified when my Credit Report showed them. 
I want all these debts removed immediately."

385124,Credit reporting,"In summary : I have an issue with a JCPenney transaction from XX/XX/XXXX that has negatively affected my credit. It is a valid transaction but I never received a bill. I am requesting that it be expunged from all XXXX creidt bureaus. 
I purchased an item in XX/XX/XXXX for about {$35.00} at JCPenney but did not have my JCP credit card. They looked it up and posted it on an old JCP card that we no longer had, instead of the current one. Since we had n't used it for over 6 years and two household moves, we never received the bill nor any follow-on statements. I first I discovered the transaction when I found it on my annual credit report review about a year later in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time it was negatively affecting my credit score and I thought it was fraud since I did not have the card or the account it was referencing ( plus it had an incorrect name as XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX ). I tried to have it removed for several months as fraud, speaking with and sending letters to both JCPenney and Synchrony Bank ( who processes their card ). In XX/XX/XXXX, I determined it must have been legitimate based on the location and time of purchase which was disclosed to me at that time by Synchrony Bank. lt was in our home town in Ohio and we were there at the time. I paid the amount they indicated ( with fees at {$53.00} ) on XX/XX/XXXX and confirmation number XXXX. I was told to wait 2-3 weeks and then dispute the charge through each of the XXXX credit bureaus so that JCP/Synchrony would erase it with notification back to those bureaus. In late XX/XX/XXXX, I talked with each of the bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) and each entered a dispute back to JCP/Synchrony. I have heard back from XXXX of the XXXX Bureaus indicating that JCP/Sychrony felt the transaction was valid, paid and nothing more would be done. 
This is unacceptable. I have had excellent credit for 50 years. I have no other negative marks on my credit, having XXXX-XXXX mortgages over the yearts and currently holding XXXX bank credit cards and XXXX-XXXX retail credit cards. This will negatively affect my credit for at least another 5 years. I need your help to erase this transaction information from my credit reports. I could not pay the bill since I never received a bill back in XX/XX/XXXX since the retail clerk posted it to the wrong account."
264797,Consumer Loan,"In XXXX my husband and I received a flier for a special Sears Home Services was having for new windows + installation with approved credit and no interest financing for a period of time. We had done all of our research, had been pre-approved for the loan and were ready to buy the product. The saleswoman came to our house and spent THREE hours on the demonstration, even though we told her exactly what we wanted within the first 15 minutes of her arrival. It was after XXXX when she left and I had an 11 month, a young child, and I was pregnant and told her we just wanted to make it quick. She charged the approximately {$10000.00} to our Sears Credit Line. After she finally left, we were told the contractor would be in touch to schedule the work that week. We never heard from him and called him numerous times. ( XXXX of Sears selling points, btw, is that they use their own contractors - NO - they hire 3rd pary independent contractors. We called the sales woman back, customer service, anyone we could think of. Two months had passed XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX - I made payments in both of those months. By XXXX I called Sears and said I would n't make any more payments and that I wanted my money back. The customer service representative was very nice this time and said "" let me see what I can do '' - that afternoon we heard from the contractor for the first time. He said he would be out the next week to measure our windows. He did n't come when he said so again we called him multiple times. He finally came later that week to measure and said the windows would be installed the following week. Again, two weeks went by with no calls and no response to my calls, so I called Sears again and said I would n't make a payment until I received my windows or I wanted my money back ( this was the end of XXXX - three months after the purchase - and I did not make a payment that month ). I did not make a payment in the month of XXXX either, though the contractor did come back and say he ordered the wrong windows so it would be another few weeks. Our windows were finally installed in XXXX - 6 months after purchase - they ruined some of the walls around the windows and made a huge mess with the installation, but at least we finally had the windows. I did make payments that XXXX and was never late again. I have requested multiple times that Sears have the derogatory remarks removed from my credit report - they held me and my money hostage and of all of the accounts I have, I have no other late payments. I am trying to refinance my house right now and this is affecting me negatively. Please do what you can to help me have these XXXX late payments from XXXX removed from my credit reports. Thank you for helping me."
15342,Student loan,"I writing because I believe that Heartland ESCI intentionally provides little and ineffective communication with borrowers that uses inappropriate messaging for their financial benefit. 

My XXXX student loans from XXXX University were sold to Heartland ESCI. They have been in deferment for the past 2 1/2 years because I was in XXXX school. Consequently, it has been 2 1/2 years since I completed the exit interview for my XXXX student loans -- a long time to remember the intricacy of loans details. Six month after my XXXX school graduation, I got emails from XXXX about my student loans from XXXX school and XXXX. I have since been up to date on all payment. Since I had loans from both institutions upwards on XXXX on XXXX, I was wrongfully under the impression those were all my loans. Because I never received a notice from XXXX and Heartland ESCI a payment was due and their was huge lapse ( 2 1/2 years ) since I signed my exit interviews, I believed all my loans were in my Navient account. 

Yesterday, I got an email from XXXX saying that I was past due on 2 months of payments of loans. This is the first time I received notification that I had payment due for those loans. I called the same day the email was sent. XXXX indicated the company ( Heartland ESCI ) they sold my loans to, had tried to reach me through email, phone, and mail. I only received one form of communication, email. I called Heartland ESCI to verify their records that those communications ( email/mail/phone ) were sent to me. Their were only records of dates for the mail ( XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ) and email. I never received a phone call from them and they had no record they made any. As for mail, I moved in XX/XX/XXXX after graduation and had put a forwarding address. I am unsure why those correspondences did n't arrive to me, but supposedly they were sent. However, in the emails I received from Heartland ESCI, the subject line read 'Your electronic statement is ready ', but no mention in the entire email that a balance was due. I believe that Heartland ESCI did n't communicate the proper and clarifying information of what was needed of me to pay my loans because it in their interest for me to be delinquent in payment. 

My situation is n't unique ; students accrue XXXX and XXXX loans with years between when they sign student loan contracts. That time lapse and other pressures like securing a job, moving after graduation, bills, etc are competing for student 's attention. It is irresponsible of Heartland ESCI to not communicate effectively that a payment was due in the channel of most responsive communication. I got an email from my university with the subject line XXXX STUDENT LOANS and responded in a few hours, because the messaging was direct. Based on the pressures of recently graduated students, data of how students communicate that Heartland ESCI and other lenders have, its well-documented data emails are the most effective ways to communicate with student loan borrowers. 

What 's more, one can only start making payments on Heartland ESCI, if they make an account. If Heartland ESCI system recorded my payments were 'delinquent ' and that I had yet to make an account, why did n't they do their due diligence to send an email or notification to make this account like XXXX ? Also when trying to pay all balances due, Heartland ESCI tried to charge me a 6 % service fee! If I paid that every time, my student loan interest rates have effectively doubled. This does n't seem right and I know I am not alone on this! Consequently, Heartland ESCI proves itself to be predatorily set-up so that student loan borrower do n't get effective communication to stay on top of my student loans. 

Both XXXX and Heartland ESCI reported to the credit bureau that I was delinquent, but I do n't think they a full account of the situation."

751515,Mortgage,"We fell behind on our mortgage a while back, the company we originally signed with, XXXX XXXX Loans, sold to Bayview Loan Servicing and we did not get informed of this as it was happening but rather thru the bill. Life happened around us, our oldest daughter had a XXXX that resulted with XXXX her mom. This daughter kept us occupied along with my own struggle of XXXX and my husband working XXXX jobs to try making ends meet. We did n't and fell further behind. We were approved with a XXXX program, but the 3rd month a submitted payment a couple days too late. We reapplied, over and over and over.

They delay with several letters at once, each contradicting themselves, even a lawyer looked over our papers and said as much. She of course told us we have a lawsuit against them. We just want to make our mortgage right and keep our home. Of course with "" bad credit '' we ca n't get a loan to pay our past due balance and the mortgage company has put us off for so long we are in a foreclosure process. Again, we desperately want to keep our home and looking for answers to do so."
268908,Mortgage,"We would like to file a complaint against both XXXX Bank and Nationstar for mediating in bad faith throughout our almost 3 year mediation process. We bought our house in XXXX and paid all of our bills on time. In XXXX, XXXX. Complications XXXX resulted in 2 years off work, and granted federal XXXX. We continued to pay our mortgage, but reached out to XXXX for refinance options when our savings was almost exhausted. We were told that despite credit scores over XXXX, we did not qualify for a refinance because XXXX was not working. Rather, XXXX said the only possible way to keep our house was to miss 2 mortgage payments and file for a loan modification. We contacted an attorney to guide us through the process, and missed our first mortgage payment in XXXX XXXX. 
We were told the process would take approximately 6 months. As stated earlier, it has been almost three years, though neither bank has been able to explain why it has taken so long. We have responded to requests for documentation, on time, from the banks at least 26 times, with at least 5 of these times being requests for material AFTER the banks told us there would not be a need for further paperwork. Furthermore, after almost two years of working with XXXX Bank, XXXX sold our loan to Nationstar days before an offer was due to us, without any warning. Nationstar then started the entire modification process over, after holding our file for almost 3 months. After 3 years, 5 actual mediations, 5 postponed mediations and multiple delays and mistakes, Nationstar finally promised us an offer. Instead, after missing yet another deadline, Nationstar sent an email to our lawyer requiring 6 trial payments totaling almost {$39000.00} before a final offer would be made. 
Our attorney has been trying to find out what the terms of the final offer might be, but can not get the information from Nationstar. Based on a conversation with opposing counsel, it sounds like the final offer will simply revert back to the original loan terms, EXCEPT it will ADD 15 years to our original loan ( becoming a 40 year term ), lock the loan in at the original rate of 6.375 % ( which is 2-3 % above the current jumbo rate ), and add approximately {$200000.00} to our loan amount ( which continues to grow with each passing month and missed payment ), modifying our principal to an amount nearly {$400000.00} above the current value of our house. We are in a worse situation now than we were when we started. 
We 've cooperated with all request made by XXXX banks under the threat of losing the possibility of modifying if we did n't. We have met our deadlines and provided all requested information -over and over again - in hopes that doing so would reap a positive solution. However, based on this last incident with the bank, we have lost all confidence that the banks are really working with us to find a good solution. In fact, the exact opposite seems true. Therefore, we have decided to file this complaint. Additionally, the mediator, XXXX XXXX, has indicated that he will grant us a bad-faith certification against both XXXX and Nationstar. 
All we want is the opportunity to stay in our home. During this process XXXX and I have earned additional degrees which resulted in new jobs that increased our income by roughly {$60000.00} per year, and we have paid off our debts expect for XXXX car loan. Attached, please find a detailed timeline of the multiple requests for information, delays, postponements, and mistakes by both XXXX and Nationstar. Anything you could do to intervene and help us would be so very greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your time and attention to our case.

Thecreditor refused to send me historical information about the account and directed me to dispute my inquiry with them directly with the credit bureau ( violation of my rights under FCRA ) I then disputed the accounts with Experian, by certified letter, asking them to delete the account from my bureau because the creditor was purposefully reporting bad information. 
Experian "" investigated '' and reported back to me that they were only requiredto validate my accounts. They remained on my reports. At this point, Experian accepted information from the creditor, knowing it was in error, because they had proof that the creditor refused to provide me, the consumer, with they information I requested about the accounts. It is my understanding, by law, if I dispute an account with a creditor, they are to mark the account as in dispute ( they never did, another FCRA violation ) and not report additional information to Experian until they provide me with documentation validating the the amount of the debt they claim I owe them. I never stated to them that I refused to pay, only that I wanted proof of accounting of the debt, because I believed they allowed charges on my account that I did not authorize. 
I then requested by certified letter, for Experian to provide me with the Method of Verification that they used to continue to report bad information on my report, requesting that they send me the documentation that they received from the original creditor, and theyonce again refused to provide. They also stated to me that my re-investigation requests were excessive and irrelevant. I was being put in a corner because the creditor directed me to Experian, Experian directed me back to the creditor, and no one was giving me answers about the information this creditor is reporting to the bureaus. 
I believe Experian is processing my requests through their automated system XXXX, only. They are not reading or reviewing any documentation that I send to them, nor are they asking the creditor to investigate. They are taking the same information that the creditor has been giving them as if it is correct, knowing that I do not agree with and have been given no chance to review or dispute what is being reported while knowing that the creditor will not prove the amount of the debt they claim I owe them. 
I am lost as to what to do at this point, I am not able to get answers from anyone. This account is hurting my credit and my credit score, blocking me from getting new credit to re-establish myself.

As a result I prepaid my real estate taxes through XXXX XXXX, XXXX and sent Ditech a receipt showing the tax is now paid. I have also for the last three months paid my principle and interest payments on time. I have receipts of all transactions. 
My rationale for paying my taxes and homeowners separately at this point is that Ditech has not demonstrated to me the competancy of computing and paying my taxes on my behalf. I do not understand their computation and they refused to respond to my questions. The only response I did receive is "" Your mortgage payment is now 60 days past due and your account may be referred too for foreclosure.

537297,Mortgage,"To summarize : First Niagara raised my mortgage payment by almost 40 % due to an error in their automation.They may be able to give you more information on their process than I could but as I understand it, they analyze the next year 's taxes to figure out the escrow payment for the next year. 

In XXXX XXXX I received a letter from XXXX that said my payment would be going up to {$1000.00} from {$720.00}. Confused, I ended up reaching out to them for an explanation. I spoke to a very nice person who let me know that they have an automation that projects the next years taxes. The way this automation works is they take the amount of last years city 's taxes and base the payment off of that. The particular city I live in ( XXXX ) had a supplemental bill go out in XXXX. This bill was only {$130.00} ( the first bill was the normal tax bill ) so the analyzed escrow was based off of only {$130.00} when it should have been based off another amount. 

First Niagara claims I should have paid attention to my payment and that this was MY responsibility to catch and figure out. There is now a significant shortage with my escrow which caused my payment to go up. Until I called in, First Niagara offered no alternatives to alleviating the burden of this extra monthly cost. 

My wife and I have an escrow because of all the benefits it has for the consumer and servicer/lender. This was not our error. As of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I asked First Niagara for alternatives to my huge increase in payment. I have listed them below : 1. Reduce the shortage by paying a one time lump sum payment ( not odeal since we 're talking about {$2000.00} ) 2. Spread the shortage over a number of months ( 24-48 ) Can you please advise on this matter and let me know if there is any precedent for this? Again, XXXX 's automation caused this issue to happen and they never discovered the issue until I was short. Their response was to send a letter informing me my payment would increase over 30 %. 

Thank you for your time."

Report includes all my car loans starting in XXXX. What is the relevance of a car loan I took 23 years ago? How absurd is this? Even though I 've never had a late payment, the length of my history works against me. The report does not distinguish between "" concurrently open '', "" historically '' and "" currently open ''. It is adding together without any distinction among mortgage, car loans and credit cards. 

The report is supposed to provide a fair representation of my insurance risk, yet the ways LexisNexis is going about it is discriminatory against those with lengthy history. And those with lengthy history are by definition older and deserve the protection of the law!"

They did not provide me with a single piece of documentation showing this belonged to me. They sent me a letter stating they do n't have reason to believe it is anyone else account. At this point they realized they need to stop reporting it in XX/XX/XXXX. They did not stop actually reporting it though until XX/XX/XXXX in which at that point they went and sold it to XXXX XXXX XXXX. They then reported on my Credit report that they sold it in XX/XX/XXXX! This is not the case as I have attached copies of my report showing it was still being reported by capital one all the way up until XX/XX/XXXX. They have also had all pieces of information mis-matching all XXXX bureaus with account status, date opened, balance, past due amount, and payment history. I have contacted them directly to get this taken care of. They told me that it is not them and that in fact it is the bureaus that are reporting the information incorrectly. I then contacted the bureaus who in return said Capital One and XXXX XXXX XXXX is reporting it this way. So they are giving me the run around. I am at a dead end because they are not following the FCRA Regulations. They have different information on all XXXX reports showing information that is clearly not proven with any documentation or the reports would match one another. 
Bottom line, Capital One sold this debt when they were told to delete it by the credit bureaus because they could not provide the information necessary to satisfy the dispute. They then went on to sell it months later and told XXXX XXXX to report that it was sold to them XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is now violating FCRA regulations by reporting false information and incomplete information without any documentation that has been requested numerous times.

What is the exact number of claims allowed and how exactly did water damage claims exceed that amount, especially since we are reopening claims that were not completed properly the first time around. 

My concern is that Ocwen Loan Servicing may be calling the shots telling my insurance company what they are permitted to do and trying to control my insurance to an extent that may be illegal. Ocwen attempted to illegally seize my home immediately after posting {$76000.00} of Keep Your Home California money and {$5000.00} Hamp incentive that I was awarded for never being late, never missing a payment for six years since the XX/XX/XXXX Loan Mod. If not for the CFPB complaints I made immediately, Ocwen would have reversed the loan mod and called the loan due as they told me they were in the process of doing. 

I need you to confirm that Ocwen is not forcing XXXX to terminate my insurance. Will this action lower my credit score and make it difficult for me to refinance and escape Ocwen? 

Please send me proof that the number of claims exceeds underwriting guidelines. Are those guidelines written by OCWEN to protect Ocwen instead of the home owner 's property? In some conversations with Ocwen employees Ocwen seemed to be indicating that my homeowners insurance belonged to Ocwen, that I pay for it but it is to protect Ocwen 's interests, not mine.

582870,Credit card,"This matter deals with Capital One 's practices concerning automatic payment enrollment for their credit cards, which I believe violates the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and its accompanying regulation B, general fair lending principles, the Consumer Financial Protection Act 's prohibition on unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, FTC Section 5, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud Protection Act. 

As you can see from the class action I am prepared to file, attached to this letter, Capital One has told me a number of times that it restricts its enrollment in automatic payments to online only. Because of this restrictive practice, Cardholders who do not have internet access, or who can not or do not want to register for online activity, are deprived of the ability to make automatic payments. Cardholders who do not sign up for automatic payments are more likely to forget to make a payment, thereby incurring late fees and additional interest charges. Capital One in fact charges late fees when Cardholders do not make timely payments, and reports those late fees as part of the Cardholder 's balance to the major credit reporting agencies. I myself have incurred late fees and additional interest charges several times due to the fact that Capital One will not allow me to enroll in automatic payments via telephone. 

Capital One reports Cardholder balances to the XXXX major credit reporting agencies, inclusive of the late fees and additional interest charges incurred because they are unable to enroll in automatic payments. Cardholders who do not have internet access, or have limited access, or who prefer not to engage in online activity are disadvantaged by Capital One 's practice of limiting enrollment in automatic payments to online only, or alternatively, are disadvantaged by Capital One 's practice of misleading Cardholders into thinking that they can not enroll in automatic payments via telephone. 

As you know, Cardholders who do not have internet access, or have limited access, or who prefer not to engage in online activity are more likely to be elderly, lower income, minorities or active military. I believe Capital One 's practice of restricting automatic payments to online access only has a discriminatory effect on members of protected classes under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 

To the extent Capital One does allow telephone enrollment in automatic payments, its practice of telling Cardholders that enrollment is limited to internet only is false, misleading, and designed to force Cardholders to incur late fees and additional interest charges, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act and Section 5."
282199,Bank account or service,"I used my Chase debit/ATM card in XXXX to withdraw cash in local currency XXXX XXXX XXXX. Upon returning, I discovered that Chase charges three percent ( 3 % ) of the withdrawal amount as a fee surcharge. This is on top of whatever Chase is making on the exchange rate. I do not begrudge a bank making money. But three percent ( 3 % ) is outrageous. There should be a warning when you make an overseas withdrawal that you will be charged three percent by Chase. This would allow the consumer to decline the transaction and avoid the fee. When I called Chase to complain, they told me that the 3 % fee was in the credit card service agreement and they were unwilling to reverse these charges. The only reason not to warn the customer is to hide or obscure this fee because almost no one would pay it were they aware of it before incurring it.

I would also like to add, throughout the last 10 years these creditors have continuously reported to the credit bureau 's for citations that have been paid.

Since then, I 've been getting the run around from this company. 

Their story was that XXXX credited the split payment made in XXXX as additional principal, and not as my XXXX XXXX mortgage payment. They informed me they would remove the full mortgage payment from my total principal paid, and credit it as my XXXX XXXX mortgage payment. This did not happen. On XXXX XXXX, I called back to find out why it did not. "" XXXX '' informed me she was aware of the situation, that she had e-mailed the issue to her supervisor, and that her supervisor had e-mailed the finance supervisor to fix the issue. Now, the additional principal was to be drawn out of my total principal and applied as my XXXX XXXX mortgage payment. Again, this did not happen. 

I called back on XXXX XXXX and spoke with "" XXXX. '' After an interminable hold, she informed me a supervisor would look into the issue and contact me in 24-48 hours. That did not happen either. I called back on XXXX XXXX, and discussed the issue with "" XXXX, '' ( female ) who informed me that she would send another e-mail to finance to inform them of the issue, but that it was possible the issue was being worked, since fixing my account could take up to 15 days after my previous call of XXXX XXXX. 

On XXXX XXXX, after realizing there was still no resolution to my issue, I called Carrington again. After another interminable hold, "" XXXX '' put me in contact with a supervisor, "" XXXX, '' who said I needed to provide all my bank statements from XXXX onward to prove I had made the payments I claim. On XXXX XXXX, my bank faxed all pertinent documentation, with annotation, to "" XXXX '' at the e-fax number he provided ( XXXX. ) I sat down and combed through my financials and have ascertained the following : Per my bank, I have made payments as follows since XXXX - {$620.00} - to XXXX ( half my XXXX XXXX mortgage as explained above ) XXXX/XXXX/2015 - {$620.00} - to XXXX ( half my XXXX XXXX mortgage as explained above ) XXXX/XXXX/2015 - {$1200.00} - to Carrington ( for XXXX XXXX mortgage* ) - transaction # XXXX - {$1200.00} - to Carrington ( for XXXX XXXX mortgage* ) - transaction # XXXX - {$1200.00} - to Carrington ( for XXXX XXXX mortgage** ) - transaction # XXXX - {$1200.00} - to Carrington ( for XXXX XXXX mortgage*** ) - transaction # XXXX I paid {$1200.00}, vice my regular mortgage of {$1200.00}, as prior to the mortgage transfer XXXX had informed me of an escrow shortage requiring an increase of {$4.00} per month** I went back to paying {$1200.00}, as Carrington apparently was n't informed of the escrow analysis by XXXX*** Per Carrington '"

205016,Credit card,"Around the XXXX of XXXX XXXX I contacted Bloomingdale 's Credit Card Services ( XXXX ) to verify my account limit. After inputting my card number and other identifying information I was advised that my credit limit was {$2000.00}. I actually thought that my limit was much higher than that. About 5 days later I received a letter from Bloomingdale 's dated XXXX XXXX XXXX stating : "" Why we 're writing you It 's been a pleasure to have you as Bloomingdale 's Credit Card customer and to serve your credit needs. We are sorry to hear that you no longer wish to keep your account. As you requested, we have closed your Bloomingdale 's Credit Card account. '' After reading the letter I immediately called Bloomingdale 's at XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX to advise that I never requested to have my account closed. The Bloomingdale 's representative indicated that my account was closed in XXXX XXXX which was a surprise to me because around XXXX XXXX XXXX I was informed I had a {$2000.00} credit limit! 
I requested that my account be re-opened because their letter falsely accuses me of requesting a closure of my account. The representative then transferred me to her supervisor. I then re-iterated my concerns to the supervisor at Bloomingdale 's Credit Card Services again stating that I never requested to have my account closed and just a week earlier I was informed that I had a {$2000.00} limit. I also indicated that the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act affords me the right to receive an "" adverse action '' letter from a creditor if they took an adverse action against me. I did not receive such a letter in XXXX XXXX stating my account would be closed and I did not request to have my account closed in XXXX XXXX. I then requested that the supervisor re-instate my account and she advised that she would have to transfer me to yet another department that could handle that request. I was placed on hold and then a gentleman came on the line, I greeted him and after several "" Hellos '' he did not respond anymore so I disconnected the call. 
I am very concerned about my credit reports and my credit scores being adversely affected by the closure of a 7 year old account with Bloomingdale 's which was in perfect standing and for no reason of my own. Also, it seem peculiar that the gentleman in the Bloomingdale 's credit department would not respond after coming on the line and has not called me back to discuss the matter."
739497,Student loan,"I am applying for help because I saw the article regarding XXXX XXXX ( as well as other private schools ) fraudulent student loan charges. It says "" XXXX XXXX XXXX along with various other branches of Mother Company XXXX have been under scrutiny for the past few years and have recently become a part of a decree from the government to forgive over XXXX in loans. Certain dubious acts have come to light such as falsified information, predatory lending, aggressive marketing, law suits and even as far as to receive a notice of request to delist XXXX. '' This is for my son whose {$80000.00} student loan turned into {$190000.00}. While all of his federal loans were deferred till he XXXX, his private loans were accruing interest the whole time he was in school. Unbeknownst to us, they did n't tell us he should 've been making some type of payment while in school. After he XXXX, he received a statement of how much he was going to have to fork over each month. It was close to {$1600.00}. So I called XXXX XXXX, at that time and after she reviewed his case she told me he qualified for a LOT more federal loans than what he received. This set a huge red flag with us right away!! These lead us to believe that the XXXX XXXX receives some type of kickback off private loans. Of course, when I contacted the financial office at XXXX they denied it all. What 's even worse, they never told us anything about most of these loans being private, not outside of when he first applied and of course we had to apply XXXX year at a time ( or it might 've been one semester at a time ) My husband and I had to co-sign for XXXX of these private loans. When XXXX of them came due, the payments were over {$1100.00}. He had n't even graduated yet!!! Since we co-signed we had to come up with the money. Since there was no way we could make that kind of monthly payment, we had to pull $ XXXX form our XXXX. XXXX still had an outstanding private loan from that bank that he could n't pay for either. The boy had no choice to file bankruptcy on his XXXX credit cards and car. At XXXX he had to move back home with no hope of getting a family anytime soon. 
Being that school loans do n't allow for bankruptcy, we just knew bank/loan agencies were n't allowed to call him during this period, so we figured this XXXX bank ( XXXX ) not necessarily forgot but was deciding what to do. Come tax season, ( after he already filed ) he received a XXXX from the collection agency for XXXX with a forgiveness of {$4100.00}. I know this was n't the full amount. When I called them about it she just told me he was required to pay taxes on it. I asked her if this is just interest and the rest wrote off or if it was just for 2014. She really did n't give a clear answer. After talking to a tax professional, XXXX most of which said they were n't aware student loans could be forgiven ) After reviewing some of the choices that the tax software gave, it was concluded he did not have to pay taxes on it. Still not sure what that loan will do to him down the road. The rest of his loans are through XXXX XXXX ( now Navient ). There 's XXXX in there that we co-signed for which he is paying on now. He was able to work with a consolidation place and got his payments down to {$800.00} a month for a year. He must reapply each year. He has another place that would reduce his payments to {$5.00} for XXXX years but not sure if he got that approved. I helped him apply for a so-called Student Loan Forgiveness through the phone number that was provided with the article. Come to find out ( which does n't surprise me ) it was for federal only. In my eyes, I see forgiveness as your debt will be wiped clean. ( or at least a huge portion ) This place was about the same way as the XXXX he applied to.

Phone call to Freedom Mortgage Sat XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Issue - Principal only payments had not been applied to the principal. 
A FM representative gave me some options, one option was to return my principal only payments. The options offered were unacceptable and I asked to be transferred to a manager. Instead of reaching a manager, I was transferred to XXXX in the Escalations Department. She was not helpful and often interrupted. I explained the principal only payments I made were not applied to the principal only. Those principal only payments were sent from XXXX XXXX XXXX bill pay in the amounts of {$3000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX, {$2000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX and {$1000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX. I stated FM had given me the principal only payment address to send online Principal only payments from my XXXX XXXX XXXX bill pay. I informed XXXX, I called back and spoke with a second FM representative to double check the address to ensure it was correct. XXXX said she had never heard of that address. I said it was not logical that XXXX FM reps had given me the same address and the payments were going to FM ; one was applied to the principal only. She asked if there was anything else she could do for me. I responded yes ; however, she hung up on me. 
The other issue was the a Monthly auto draft which I had set up with F M as an auto draft in XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$1200.00} with regular P & I payments of {$1100.00} and {$100.00} principal only. I established auto draft to ensure all payments would be correctly and timely processed. This also was incorrectly done for the XXXX XXXX XXXX payment. 
The regular Monthly XXXX XXXX house payment had not been applied. On XXXX XXXX FM incorrectly paid {$1000.00} to Principal, {$100.00} to Principal and {$130.00} to P & I and resulting in the house payment of {$1100.00} not applied. I was not able to address this since XXXX hung up on me. I called back and asked for a Supervisor. I was told I would receive a return call from a Supervisor. 
Monday XXXX XXXX, I received the return call. I went over each principal payment incorrectly applied and asked they be correctly applied on the dates I had specified and not on a later date, to avoid paying more interest than necessary. 
Those principal only payments were sent from XXXX XXXX XXXX bill pay in the amounts of {$3000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX, {$2000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX and {$1000.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX confirmation # XXXX. 
I informed the FM supervisor the auto draft XXXX XXXX XXXX incorrectly paid {$1000.00} to Principal and {$130.00} to P and I ; making an incomplete house payment to P & I and applied {$100.00} to Principal. I informed him the Monthly paper statements I receive do not match the Loan Overview online. Example the statement dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX shows payment due XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the loan overview online shows the next payment due XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Both do not reflect payments posted properly. 
I asked to be sent an amortized itemized listing with corrections showing the beginning balance, date of regular payments and all additional principal only payments reflecting the running balance. I mentioned the conversation to him and I was hung up on by XXXX in the escalations Department. The supervisor said the corrections would be completed in two days, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and the itemized accounting statement.

I found out through Ocwen that My Ex husband was not making payments. I went on further with Ocwen to come to a agreement that I was told was going to help me become current. I was told to come up with a {$2000.00} down payment and to follow the payment plan. which I have done for about 18 months now. I was also told that my payment would not change. In XX/XX/XXXX I was diagnosed with XXXX and was hospitalized for 2 months. I was never notified by Ocwen that my monthly payment changed until I talked to my relationship manager XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I have payed extra monthly, which I later found out that the extra I have been paying Ocwen set aside and did not even apply to the back balance. Throughout this process I found out that Ocwen is also charging me for several modification applications and fees associated with that process. I have talked to my relationship manager monthly for over a year just to be told there is nothing they can do for me and I am further behind then when I started there agreement that is labeled Modification Forbearance Agreement. The only goal I wanted to achieve was to keep my house for my family and I feel they have done nothing to help this at all. Ocwen has been marking me as late/non payment on my credit even though I have been paying them on time for over a year now."

After going into default I went through the Mortgage Adjustment Program ( MAP ). The first time through the payment was very near the original payment and with only about 30 days notice I was unable to begin the trial period. I submitted a second time with only my income as my wife and I separated and she no longer lived on the premises or shared in the costs. I was approved and received final MAP agreement around XX/XX/2017. I have until XX/XX/XXXX to accept. The bank has added $ XXXX to my principal for missed payments. There is no discussion or negotiation. My principal went from {$140000.00} to {$180000.00}. When I inquired, I was told that they simply tacked on 41 missed payments to the end of the loan. The predatory nature of this is that I did not BORROW more money, I missed payments. Logic would dictate that I would be charged interest for the 41 missed payments, not the amount of each payment including the portion that would be applied toward the principal. I am being charged my own principal payments??? How is this legal?"

I continued to pay at least my normal payment until the balance of the extension interest was paid in full in XX/XX/XXXX. Then "" their system '' allowed for my payments to be credited to the account. My credit report shows 5 months of missed payments when in fact there were XXXX months of missed payments.

After enrolling, I learned that the interest rate discount is lower than initially informed. I communicated with my servicer and was informed that the different "" disbursements '' in my account offer different interest rate reductions. In addition to making almost two years worth of regular payments and not knowing that I could reduce my interest rate with auto-payments, I was never informed that there were multiple "" disbursements '' on my account. I have now payed over {$3200.00} in additional payments over the last 8 months that would have payed off at least one disbursement that did not offer a lower interest rate, thereby reducing my weighted interest rate faster.

444402,Bank account or service,"On XXXX/XXXX/17, I went into Citibank located at XXXX in XXXX, VA - I was there to withdraw money from their ATM and to make an emergency deposit for someone. After withdrawing money, I proceeded to the teller window to make the deposit. The branch did not have deposit slips available, so I had to write the persons name and account number on a sticky note. The teller, XXXX, asked me if I had an account and I replied 'no '. She told me that I had to show a valid drivers license in order to make a deposit. I asked her why, because I was only depositing {$300.00}, and that I was n't requiring money back in change. She told me that it was required by the bank and Federal Government. Also, she said that if I had a check to deposit instead, then I would not need to provide my personal information and identification. I asked to speak with a branch manager at this point. The branch manager, XXXX, asked me what the issue was. I explained to him that I was only making a deposit and why they needed my drivers license and personal information. He told me that it was required by Federal Government Law and it was bank policy. I asked for written literature of this or documentation but he did not have this information. It was basically verbal. I asked him if I could find this info on their website and he said its not available. I asked for the Corporate contact information and he said he could not provide this to me. I also asked if I could speak with the District Manager, but again he said that he could not give me that information because it was for internal employees only. He instead gave me the Customer Service number to speak with an agent. I told him that I would need to speak with a District Manager because I did not agree with their verbal policy regarding identification being required to make a deposit. He explained that it was the only way I could make this transaction unless I had a check - otherwise they would need my personal information if I did n't have my drivers license. I had to make the deposit, so I proceeded back to the teller 's window and presented my drivers license. She took the information and gave me a receipt. The transaction took about 10 minutes for her to enter my license and personal information. I asked her for the District Manager 's information and she said she did n't have it. She asked me to get it from the Branch Manager. I told her that I already spoke to him and that I was not granted that information. She then asked her colleague and was told to give me the manager 's email address. She gave me the email address and did not apologize for the inconvenience. I was concerned at this point because she initially told me that she did not have the managers information, and the branch manager said the same thing. After leaving the branch I called their customer service at XXXX. I asked to speak with a Supervisor and that I wanted to make a complaint. A supervisor named XXXX came to the phone after 10 minutes or so. He told me that it was a Federal Government law which required them to ask for my license and personal information to make a cash deposit and that all banks do this. I told him that it was n't true because I made similar deposits at other banks like XXXX and XXXX, and they never asked for my license. He said that it was bank policy as well and it was for any amount of cash. I asked for the District Manager 's number and he told me that he could not give me that information. He said I could only file a complaint and that even if he called the manager, they would not answer the call. He then said that if I did not have my license I would need to provide my social security number and personal information. He told me that the bank did not have to post this policy anywhere nor online because it was Federal Law. The bank did not help me and treated me unfairly."

415266,Student loan,"I obtained multiple student loans from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX totaling approximately {$13000.00}, during which time I obtained XXXX degrees and graduated on time. During this time the student loan servicer sold my loan to several different loan servicers and incorrectly placed me into a repayment status, even though I was a XXXX and in good standing with the university during this entire time. As far back as my first semester in college XX/XX/XXXX I started receiving harracement from credit collectors hired by the student loan servicer at the time. They would call a harrace my parents and even call me at work when I started my first job XX/XX/XXXX. Also during this time, they began charging penalties and interest to my account balance and by the time I graduated XX/XX/XXXX my principal balance had increased to approximately {$23000.00} and I was not given my 6 month grace period after graduation, as was promised by the lender. Furthermore, because I was being harraced so frequently by the credit collectors, I obtained a XXXX XXXX Smart Consolidation loan as I was advised to do so by my loan servicer at the time. At that time they told me this was my only option or they would begin wage garnishment. They also told me that they could then go back and correct the situation with the penalties and interest that were incorrectly applied to my account balance. Which, they never did. So I began making payments on this loan in XX/XX/XXXX until I got laid off from my job in XX/XX/XXXX, when the payments were so high that I could not make them. From XX/XX/XXXX to approximately XX/XX/XXXX I requested 60 months of voluntary forbearance to keep the loan from going into default during the time I was laid off and had to take a XX/XX/XXXX cut in pay. During this time my loan balance increased to approximately {$32000.00}. FromXX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I began making regular payments on my loan as I got back on my feet financially. I never let my loan go into default at any time. I always managed to make the payment and catch up whenever I got behind. However, my loan continued to increase during this time because of capitalized interest that XXXX XXXX was charging to my account. XX/XX/XXXX my loan balance increased to {$42000.00}. In frustration because the loan balance increased by {$10000.00} while I was making payments, XXXX XXXX changed the loan terms toXXXX payments of {$400.00} per month and ending on XX/XX/XXXX. From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I made XXXX of the XXXX payments totaling approximately {$48000.00} of which, approximately {$46000.00} was charged to interest. XX/XX/XXXX I received notice that Navient was concerned that I was not paying my loan off quick enough and they were raising my payment to {$670.00} per month and extending the terms to XX/XX/XXXX. Which defies all logic if they were concerned I was not paying it off fast enough. So as of the current date, I have paid over {$60000.00} toward my loan and I still have a principal loan balance of {$43000.00} and they want me to pay approximately {$60000.00} more through XX/XX/XXXX. If I agree to continue paying I will have paid over {$100000.00} toward a {$13000.00} loan. I believe that they give you the run-around on purpose to keep you confused and paying. They threaten you constantly that if you do n't pay, they will ruine you financially. So I keep paying. However, because of how this has affected my credit over the years, it has caused me significant financial harm. When I call and ask why I was charged 100 % interest for a period of 10 years, all they will tell me is that the interest accrues daily. I have hours of audio and video evidence of them giving me the run-around, as they put very little in writting. What they are doing is a crime and they should be punished for this activity."

I pay my Walmart store card early around the 1st week of every month early and the due date is the XXXX of every month. If I do n't pay my bill a couple days before the XXXX synchrony charges me another late fee. They want a double payment every month or they will charge {$35.00} late fee all the time. For a bank/financial institution they should know that the payment I sent in $ XXXX- {$45.00} IS FOR THE XXXX. I know they are thieves. If you type in a search engine complaints about synchrony bank or complaints on care credit that is XXXX of the cards synchrony has you will see all of the complaints against this bank.

264537,Mortgage,"I 'd like to lodge a complaint about the service and the subsequent underhanded methods employed by XXXX Ohio. From failing to meet mandated federal guidelines and underhanded tactics to ultimately force me to use them or possibly lose my home. 

Background I went to the bank to get some documents notarized where a bank employee introduced me to the Loan Officer. I mentioned that I was working with a Mortgage Company getting an FHA Loan. He asked why FHA and I told him I had a previous Foreclosure and it was the only option. He said I could do Conventional with 10 % down with him. 

XXXX XXXX was pleasant enough taking my application while he was on vacation right around XXXX XXXX 2016. I thought this was a very good sign and we had several weeks to go before our closing on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Unfortunately, that was the last level of service I received through the entire process. 

Any request from me was turned around within minutes and at the latest a couple of hours. My wife and I have done well to maintain a high credit score ( XXXX over XXXX ) even with a past foreclosure. However, I wanted to make sure we received the approval or rejection early because our landlord had an opportunity to rent our current home and not charge us an extra month of rent. We were absolutely positive we could qualify for a FHA as a back-up. 

Between the days off and no return calls from XXXX, his Manager and the Processor I was in a constant state of confusion as to where we were in the process. I received XXXX call from my Loan Processer to introduce herself and that was it. On the XXXX of XXXX I received a letter requesting documentation for the loan and it stated the information must be here by XXXX XXXX in order to make your closing on the XXXX. The letter itself had a XXXX XXXX date on it, strange, but true.??? 

The problems they caused other than the emotional distress which I believe they should be held accountable : 1 ) I was informed from my realtor we were not going to make our scheduled closing date, because she called XXXX Manager because XXXX was not returning calls. 
2 ) When they did finally switch products on XXXX XXXX when I was verbally quoted rates they continuously delayed providing me the XXXX. I was requesting daily until they were sent to me on XXXX XXXX via fax. Federal guidelines state I should have the Loan Estimate within 3 days of changing products. Knowing that I needed to close quickly in order to avoid losing faith with my seller or at least having to pay another month 's mortgage to the seller, it seemed like the delay was calculated based on my closing window. This could have all been avoided had they switched the product from a Conventional to an FHA several weeks earlier which they had plenty of time had any follow-up been done by the loan officer. 
3 ) The final insult was from the Customer Resolution Department. They notified me after I had decided to work with another Mortgage provider and apologized about my experience at JP Morgan Chase. They said they would look into reimbursing me the cost incurred ( {$1800.00} for additional Rent and {$1900.00} paid to my seller for missing our close date by nearly 30 days ). I was told I would hear in a day and as expected it took over a week and the Senior Manager 's decided they did n't need to reimburse us.I did n't expect they would do the right thing, but I held a glimmer of faith in their humanity. 

At the very least I would like to recoup the costs incurred for rent and the mortgage payments and see Chase get the proper sanctions for the unethical tactics employed during this process. 
I will be more than happy to provide all the documentation associated with this activity.

577846,Debt collection,"I am writing in regards to the poor service and unacceptable actions I have experienced in my dealings with XXXX and their corporate sales department, servicing department, and collection department. After entering an agreement with them to help grow our business and paying them close to $ XXXX, our experience with their development team has been abysmal, the results our company saw from their supposed services were non existent, and after numerous requests to speak with members of their staff to review our service agreement we received absolutely no response. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, specifically XXXX XXXX, entered into a service contract with one another for a total of {$20000.00} split into quarterly payments. Over the next six months, XXXX paid XXXX quarterly payments of {$5200.00} for a total of {$10000.00}. During this period, XXXX was not responsive to multiple requests from XXXX for servicing, XXXX failed to receive a single lead from its investment, and when XXXX asked XXXX for a review of the services multiple times there was never a response. 
By choosing to use their services we invested a great deal of capital ( specifically {$10000.00} ) and time into what we were sold from them. After we signed the contract and paid the money, the only time we ever heard from them was when they were asking for more money. Their failure to produce any results and failure to respond is considered a breach of contract on their part. Their breach caused its damages to our growth, we made the decision to cut our losses and ended our contract with them. 
About a year after we ceased using their services, we began to receive collection calls from XXXX. In our communications with them we requested verification of the debt, a copy of the original contract, a list of leads generated by their services for XXXX, and made the offer to enter into mediation on what XXXX considered still owing to them from us. 
We made this request on multiple occasions and were never provided anything. I thought it was odd that they were not willing to provide any documentation so we continued to call their offices and left messages. We never received a response from XXXX regarding our requests, just more collection calls demanding money. 
It eventually got to the point that we told XXXX we wanted a refund for the monies that were already paid to them. We also again told them that we were happy to enter into mediation with them regarding this matter. After this we received no further communications until XXXX XXXX, XXXX when we received an official summons from the Law Office of XXXX XXXX XXXX with notification that XXXX was being sued by Credit Adjustors Bureau ( not XXXX ) for the amount of {$10000.00} for the term of the contract with XXXX. 
Included in the complaint under exhibit "" XXXX '' is an illegible copy of the docusign agreement between XXXX and XXXX which I have been requesting for close to a year. Further, the agreement includes a copy of the terms which includes XXXX XXXX. Term and Termination. XXXX notified XXXX several times of its dissatisfaction to no avail, which lead to the breach on XXXX 's part and the cease of the agreement XX/XX/XXXX. 
Section XXXX of the agreement Dispute Resolution states the parties will attempt to resolve any dispute related to this Agreement through good faith, informal negotiation. XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX finally received communication back from XXXX ( albeit through collection calls ), XXXX made no attempt to discuss or acknowledge the breach or negotiate in any way. Instead, XXXX simply demanded more money. 
Now by turning the account over to a third party collection agency and filing suit with no notification or request for mediation, XXXX has also violated Section XXXX of the agreement."

469387,Debt collection,"Dear Sir/Madam For nearly 5 years, Select Portfolio Servicing and its agents, attorneys and principles have attempted to extort monies from me to the point of physically making me and my family sick. Eventually, they falsified a notice of trustee sale and forced me in bankruptcy ( chapter XXXX ) when there is no money due to them whatsoever. As the declaration of ex police officer and currently private investigator shows which is attached, there is no default whatsoever and all payments on a non existing loan has been received by these group of money launderers and ponzi schemers.

222157,Mortgage,"I have had multiple servicing issues with MB Financial, mostly with payment submission. 
Issues that I have experienced include : 1. Website availability - I have made multiple attempts to make payments, but received errors due to website not working. This has caused multiple sign-on attempts. I do n't understand why the website would not be available during payment due date times ( seems like a way to maximize late payment fees ) 2. Customer Service Wait Times - When I have had payment acceptance issues ( not my fault ), I would call customer service to make the payment. Wait times have normally exceeded 30 - 45 minutes to talk to a customer service representative. 
3. XXXX XXXX XXXX - I have had to have my user name re-issued multiple times. This has been caused by system changes and servicer conversions. This has caused payment submission issues. The difficulty in getting my user name took multiple website attempts and calls to customer service. 
4. Account Information Validation and Saving - It is common place in today 's payment acceptance world to both save account information to submit payments and have a recurring option to submit payments. MB Financial has neither. Also, when I have submitted account information, they have no validation to insure account information is entered correctly. 
5. Bankruptcy Declaration Letters - For each payment I have submitted, I have received information regarding bankruptcy rights and collection of delinquent accounts. I am neither in Bankruptcy ( or have ever filed Bankruptcy ) or delinquent on my account. This has caused a high level of anxiety that they are incorrectly reporting my loan status and treating me as a Bankruptcy account. 
6. Incorrect Account Information - MB Financial 's systems have provided incorrect information multiple times. I have used their automated system which has provided inconsistent information with their website. Additionally, I have tried to provide account information on the automated systems and they are unable to authenticate my account. I do not have confidence in their ability to manage my account and the financial transactions I complete. 


This servicer has been very unprofessional and needs to improve its processes and procedures to meet basic customer needs. They are definitely operating on a shoe-string budget as evidenced in their technology and customer service. Hopefully they will improve as many other customers in good standing are being treated in an unfair manner and we are paying for this company to service our loan."

She was to transfer XXXX $ to my account and let me keep XXXX of it. That set off a red flag so I made sure to ask more questions about this being legit or am I going to have to worry about bank problems? She says everything is legit nothing to worry about and she proceeded to tell me its simple, how her aunt really needs help and she 's done it before for her cousins she just ca n't do it more than once on an account because of the amount of money she is trying to transfer to the country will look like fraud. I figured her aunt was just rich ( again this is a "" friend '' so I believe it ). I met up with her cousin and gave him the card with the pin and he assured me its all okay and he 's done it before. I suspect nothing wrong at the moment. The money is in my account but theres a hold on it. So she needs more information to get it through. She needs my social security so she can use the card because the people at the bank think its a fraud. Feeling funny about this I start backing out but again she calls me telling me its all legit & that we are friends and I should not worry. Im like okay sure why not.. So i check my bank of america app on my phone later in the day and see no transfer ... but a deposit of a check from XXXX made out to my name?? Red flags are going off like crazy now & I see now this was the "" aunt '' she was speaking of. I start getting emails about fraud from my bank like crazy. Im thinking she did say something about them mistaking it for fraud. I decide to call the bank anyway just in case fearing for the worst ... and before i can get through to them ( they have me on hold forever ) I check my account & it is suddenly closed now and I cant access my stuff. I call my "" friend '' right away and she assures me everything is fine just to relax and it 'll be fixed by the next day they have to go talk to the bankers to tell them whats going on. I leave it alone for a day, hope for the best to see if my account went back to normal and nothing. My account is closed and now no word from the "" friend '' I was dealing with. I go to my bank and they tell me because I did not get back to them within the time frame my account is shut down and I will need to go to check systems about this. This was back in the end of XXXX of 2015. I have n't had the means to be able to deal with this situation & am now finally ready to file a complaint.

443354,Student loan,"I will be graduating from XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. As grades will be posted XXXX XXXX, XXXX the XXXX XXXX date is what is reported to the XXXX and my student loan companies. Discover Student Loans services a large portion of my private loans and is advising me I will receive a bill sometime after XXXX XXXX that is due XXXX XXXX. Considering Discover 's billing cycle is 23 days I have inquired why that is and they are stating if they can get a bill generated within 14 days they find this period to be reasonable. As such if my reported graduation date was the date of the actual ceremony ( a mere 6 days ) I would not have a bill due until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This seems like a direct admission that discover is using a 3 day window to unfairly demand payment. I find it unreasonable to send someone a bill and expect payment within two weeks which for most Americans is XXXX pay period. Excusing the fact that this will also be due 3 days after XXXX, the only solution Discover is offering is that they have no late fees and I will have until XXXX XXXX, XXXX before my payment is considered late. This is not a viable solution as once my loans are in repayment I will have to use XXXX checks that I receive in one month to meet the payment due. If I pay the loan the way Discover is suggesting I will continue being near the "" late date '' every month. Furthermore, for a lender that does not consider or factor your income ( {$42000.00} ) and simply requires payment based on their calculations Discover should not suggest to ANYONE how to pay their student loans based on when they are receiving paycheck considering Discover does not offer income based repayment. 

I have tried on several attempts to circumvent defaulting on my loans with Discover and have been successful thus far, however Discover advising me two weeks before a payment is due is not only inappropriate it is an unacceptable practice that should not be allowed. I am not requesting a month of forbearance or anything of the such I am requesting an appropriate billing cycle like everyone else is allowed so that I can budget between Ramen noodles, rent, and not defaulting on loans that offer little if any repayment options. 

Please also consider that I receive my current student loan statement on the XXXX of each month. As such I would receive a statement on XXXX XXXX, XXXX showing my loans are in deferment and no payment is due, to then receive a statement a week after the XXXX telling me I have 10 days to pay my loan? This is the very definition of unreasonable. 

I am looking simply to have my student loan payment due XXXX XXXX, XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX, XXXX less than two weeks after I even receive my diploma. This means my next loan statement on XXXX XXXX, XXXX would allow ample time to budget and pay the sizable amount due. 

I am not sure that this practice is illegal or discriminatory, however I am absolutely certain that is it unfair to expect graduates to make payments 17 days after their degrees are conferred which is less than the company 's billing cycle. I wonder how many other students Discover may have put in a similar situation-who then felt they had no choice but to default? 

I appreciate any assistance in this matter and look forward to your reply.

I asked the collection agency to send myself the proof they are saying verifies this, and all i get are statements. This is not mine! I never signed up for XXXX, i never allowed ti to be signed up for under my name, and i never signed a contract or agreement at any point. 

I want this erroneous account removed from my credit reports asap due to the extreme negative effect it is having on my credit score please.

80165,Credit card,"I transferred a credit card balance of approximately {$3600.00} to Pentagon Federal Credit Union ( PenFed ) on their 0 % balance transfer program in XXXX 2016. After a few months on the program, I noticed that my account was being charged interest. This is not an obvious thing as I have a Platinum 'rewards ' card and usually received some credit each billing cycle as a result of gas purchases. I did some rough math and determined that I was paying interest on purchases on an average from the purchase! Not from the billing date or the period after that! I called PedFed and talked to Customer Service. The technicians were at a loss trying to explain what was happening. I was transferred to a Lead/Supervisor named XXXX and got enough of an understanding that it came to one question : Could I pay the total balance with the advance and othe transactions and clear it up? XXXX 's response was yes. How I started paying interest on an undisclosed process bothers me a lot. I wrote a letter to PenFed 's President dated XXXX XXXX 2016."

209262,Mortgage,"Bank of America has endorsed and erected an "" intangible '' system and culture that takes advantage of the FHA program and its borrowers. My experience with Bank of America proved that this was the case and that they were not concerned with what was in my best interest. I did all that I could within my knowledge, diligence, persistence, and power for a favorable outcome on my behalf. The crux of my grievance originates from both my XXXX hard work and expertise in finding Buyers for my property seemingly all for naught. In the beginning of my short sale request, my XXXX Realtor/Broker was able to find a buyer with cash ( proof of financials and legitimate documentation ) which was given to Bank of America during the application process. My XXXX Realtor/Broker informed me that all documents were administered in the "" XXXX System '', but was having difficulty finding them. Neither my Realtor/Broker nor I was informed by Bank of America ( in XXXX through XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) that changes being made in the XXXX System would hinder the process until after the fact. Because of this, the documentation failed to be processed and I received a decline. Unfortunately, due to my Realtor/Broker 's Mother untimely passing, I elected to switch Brokers. My XXXX Broker found a Buyer right away ( as did my XXXX Broker ) who offered cash ( with all the appropriate proof of financials, authorizations, and documentation ) that offered approximately {$20000.00} more than the first offer. My second XXXX experienced the same Bank of America improprieties and challenges as my first XXXX ( i.e. not being updated by bank officials concerning the status of my short sale request ). My XXXX Broker received XXXX Declinations Letters while working on my behalf. Miscommunication or the lack of communication on the part of Bank of America since the onset of my short sale request, ; lack of continuity and/or inconsistency with bank negotiators managing my file ( where I and my Brokers were rarely able to speak with the same negotiator who was familiar with my case ), ; failure to provide informed updates to my Brokers and me as to the status of my case, ; mishandling of documentation through the "" XXXX '' system and in general by Bank of America, ; and lack of knowledge about the "" XXXX '' system ( which is supposedly the quickest and most effective apparatus in expediting documents of Bank of America short sale professionals ) was customary. I requested the short sale be initiated or reopened at least XXXX times by Bank of America 's Escalation Team, a XXXX XXXX HUD XXXX, and by Bank of America 's Office of The President. I had to go through the cancellation of my modification which took a considerable amount of time because Bank of America short sale professionals did not understand the "" full '' protocols and codes of the modification to short sale process. The preceding Declination Letters stated ... "" I failed to provide the documentation '' without any clear explanation as to what documentation was missing or needed. I had to fax documents to Bank of America 's short sale negotiator via Bank of America Branch in XXXX, Virginia. The Branch professionals notarized and spoke with the negotiator as to what was needed to expedite the process. However, at the application deadline, the negotiator stated that she never received the documents. My XXXX request for short sale was on XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX.

206743,Credit card,"This complaint is for abusive credit card dispute practices by Bank Of America. I purchased a trailer from All Seasons RV in the early summer which included a XXXX. Please examine the uploaded correspondence sent by me to B of A for the full story, which is based on misrepresentation of the XXXX. Misrepresentation of product is a valid basis for dispute for XXXX, and B of A claims they are bound to follow XXXX rules, yet they do n't. 

I filed a dispute for the {$550.00} charged to me for the XXXX for misrepresentation of the product. I had given the salesperson my age, height and weight and explained that I would travel alone, and would only purchase the XXXX if I could handle it without any help. He promised it would be no problem for me to install and set up the tent by myself, which could not be further from reality. Not only was it not possible, but it was not safe. I made multiple requests to XXXX Seasons RV to return the XXXX and get a refund, but was repeatedly turned down. So I filed a dispute with Bank Of America for the {$550.00}. I have since experienced the following multiple abusive practices by Bank of America that I want to report to the XXXX and get help with : 1. The amount I gave was entered wrong as {$500.00}. I 've repeatedly requested they correct it to {$550.00}, but the bank has refused to correct. 
2. I am not allowed to speak to anyone in dispute. Whoever is processing my claim is not reading the documents sent. They repeatedly ask for items they already have. I am not allowed to point them to the documents they keep re-requesting. Several of the Claims Agents I 've spoken with have easily located the documents that the Dispute department insists have not been sent. 
3. They sent me a list of requests with a deadline of XX/XX/2016. I went to a B of A branch in XXXX and faxed to them everything they requested on XX/XX/2016 and obtained a successful fax confirmation from the branch agent. On XX/XX/2016 the dispute dept. produced a denial letter stating I missed their deadline ( see all B of A letters XXXX and closed my case. I called and again was denied access to the team on my claim, but the XXXX said they 'd re-open my case and I could re-send everything. This time I faxed the entire packet including the successful fax confirmation sheets to ALL XXXX FAX NUMBERS, and received another denial letter, again refusing to acknowledge receipt of my on-time submission OR documents they requested. Their online upload errored out on all of my files. Sending via XXXX Mail is too slow to rely on. This is clearly their game, and constitutes an abusive practice. 
4. B of A requires me to return the XXXX to the merchant before they will finish processing my claim. It weighs over XXXX pounds, and would cost about {$75.00} to ship. It is clear the merchant refuses to refund my money. B of A is putting me at risk of losing both my money and the merchandise by requesting me to return the item without any written commitment to refund my money upon its return. I 've claimed repeatedly that I intend to return it, however not until I have the protection of a written letter from B of A that upon the return of the merchandise they will credit my account the full {$550.00} and not {$500.00}. They 've refused, and require that I forfeit the merchandise ( that I could sell online ) while remaining at risk of losing the dispute. This is abusive!

683760,Credit card,"I have US Bank XXXX personal and business credit cards. XXXX have the annual fee and it is advertized that this annual fee pays for cards benefits. XXXX of the benefits is Bonus Award Night. However they decided to remove this benefit from XXXX cards starting XXXX/XXXX/15. Based on that I believe I am not getting all benefits that I paid forwith my annual fees. And this benefit is still advertized on the application page for new customers. 
I expect the bank to refund my annual fees on XXXX card this year only because they made this change in the middle of my membership year, but I paid annual fees for the full year of membership benefits."
192614,Consumer Loan,"I have XXXX 5 year notes with BB & T that is due in XXXX XXXX. The notes are for property that I purchased where I run my business, a software development company. The loans are not only secured by the property but by my personal assets. 
Under the terms of the contracts, 1 ) I was to supply BB & T with my personal and financial returns every year within the first 90 days of the year and XXXX ) Maintain a corporate debt to income ratio of less than XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed by the Asset Recovery Division of BB & T, that I was in default of my loan for the above XXXX provisions. This was even though I was never late on a payment! I explained that BB & T did receive my financials returns, not within the first 90 days of the year, as our CPA filed late that year ( we filed for an extension. ) But they did receive the financial returns XX/XX/XXXX. With regards to the debt to income ratio, we reduced this XX/XX/XXXX after a stellar year. The bank 's response was "" If I can pre-pay off the note in XXXX XXXX, ( 6 months before it was due ), they could work with me. '' There is also a XXXX % fee for early pre-payment. I told them that 1 ) I was not going to pre-pay off the note early 2 ) I would refinance the note with another lending agency in XXXX XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, BB & T started adding additional fees to my note. They added the following fees : 1 ) {$1000.00} fee for XXXX appraisal fees -- why they would want to have the properties appraised considering my stance regarding refinance is unexplainable. There is a provision in the contract that states if an appraisal is necessary I would be responsible for that fee. Again, why would an appraisal fee be necessary if I clearly stated I would not rein finance with them? 
2 ) {$3500.00} ( approximately ) in attorney fees. One letter I received from their attorney stated that BB & T 's position is that they will not refinance their note in XXXX XXXX. I asked why I have to pay for their attorney fees and their response is that I am, in XX/XX/XXXX, still in default of the provisions of the contract. My position is 1 ) I am no longer in default as of XX/XX/XXXX, 2 ) the fees added were all assessed in XX/XX/XXXX. Since BB & T just added these fees to my current notes,, and since I disputed these fees, my loans now show as late. I have never been late for any payment. I maintain a XXXX that is 26 years old."

The new mortage payment under the TPP was more than I had been expecting at almost fifty percent of my take home pay. I consulted with my housing counselor who was unable to determine from the modification offer letter the type of modification i was being offered. My housing couselor then contacted my assisigned specialist at Fay servicing to enquire about the offer I had recieved. The specialist informed him that it was a propriortory, that the HAMP modification had been denied due to insufficant income and insufficant yeild. When my housing counselor asked him if a denial letter had been sent, he was told that no letter had been sent to me because they were able to offer me the propriotory modification. Because I was not sent a denial letter, and therefore did not know that my modification offer was not a HAMP, I was unaware of oppurtunity to appeal HAMP denial. Fay servicing specialist has advised me to appeal denial at this time however if a denial letter had been sent to me at time of HAMP denial, I could have appealed sooner and avoided delays in modification process."

In there letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, the claim that my total current balance is {$13000.00}. As it stands according to Navient, I do not owe them nor any collection agency. The debt they allege I owe is not valid nor accurate. Proof that is attached to this complaint will show that this company is illegally trying to collect on an account that is paid in full and is also closed with Navient. The account they also is past the statute of limitation based of the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act and Texas statute of limitation that is enforced by the Texas Attorney General. They have no right to collect on the account since it is paid in full. Furthermore, no documents or proof that this account is accurate was sent to me by XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. I am going to consult with my attorney or legal recourse as they are breaking several federal and state laws. Also, since Navient has been the center of several lawsuits, their selling off and transferring of accounts to deceive individuals as myself will not be tolerated. Also the fact that the XXXX loans I had with Navient : XXXX for {$4000.00} and XXXX {$2600.00} are nowhere near the doubled amount this company and Navient are trying to collect wrongfully from me."

On XX/XX/XXXX I called again and was told they did not hear from the hospital but that I owed the money. Again I requested a statement for the details. On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed a letter formally requesting the validation of the debt with the details as to the services provided.

I wrote them the 1st cease and desist letter, asking them to not contact me other then in writing form. They broke the law by calling my significant other and my self after we both requested not be contacted other then in writing, and admitted to in a letter apologizing about them contacting me. They also broke Federal Law by trying to collect on a debt that 's not owed to them and using the US mail system and court system to do their dirty work. They have not specifically proved their debt with any agreement that I entered into with because I have not. They have not proved their debt purchase because the debt was illegally purchased for pennies on the dollar."

I then called TransUnion and they had no record of the dispute, so I filed it over the phone and the representative collected my email address, but I received no notification that it was submitted or the status of it. If I log on to their website I still do n't see any indication of the the status of the dispute. 

The account I 'm attempting to dispute is "" XXXX # XXXX '' which was a debt that was sold to XXXX but not appropriately reported to TransUnion ( or TransUnion recieved the report but failed to actually file it, much like they 're doing to me now. ) This caused the debt to be duplicated when it is actually the same XXXX adverse account."

To date, 31 days later, my report remains the same as when I originally filed my complaint. Experian has sent communication indicating my credit file is accurate and I must contact creditors who made hard inquiries to challenge authorization/validation. I never made these inquiries. Why would it be my responsibility to contact someone I have n't done business with, have n't requested credit from, have n't provided my personal information, or authorized their inquiry?

284718,Bank account or service,"Starting XXXX XXXX, 2016 I started incurring overdraft fees due to insufficient funds available in my checking account. Between the dates of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I incurred a total of XXXX overdraft charges at $ XXXX/piece for a total of {$310.00}. My banking institution, Rabobank N.A. was processing transactions even though my checking account was "" overdrawn ''. 
Rabobank has taken 2 positions on this 1 : ) They claim I authorized an "" opt in '' process that allows the processing of debit transactions regardless of available funds. 2 : ) I previously signed up for "" Savings-Checking Overdraft Protection '' where funds are automatically transferred from my savings account to my checking account should the latter have the potential of being overdrawn. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I met with XXXX XXXX, a representative with Rabobank at the XXXX XXXX, CA branch. I asked that she provide me with all the documents I signed or initialed associated with the account ( s ) in question. She could NOT provide me with any documentation where I signed or initialed authorizing Rabobank to process transactions resulting in my account being overdrawn resulting in fees assessed. XXXX XXXX could not provide me documentation where I signed or initialed any kind of "" Opt In '' process. In fact, her only response was that "" I must have told someone I wanted the "" Opt In '' process. '' That is a completely unacceptable answer in my opinion. 
During my visit with XXXX XXXX, I asked that she change the "" Opt-in '' process to "" Opt-Out '' as I do not want to incur any more overdraft fees and do not have any reservations with debit transactions being denied at the merchant terminal should funds not be available. XXXX XXXX assured me that she did make the appropriate changes as requested. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I incurred another overdraft charge of {$35.00} as a result of the aforementioned "" issue ''. The changes I requested were obviously not made. 

At this point I have incurred a total of XXXX overdraft fees at $ XXXX/ea. for a total of {$350.00}.

I sent a follow-up letter on XXXX XXXX, 2016 asking them to provide me with the name, address and phone number of the person ( s ) that they contacted at XXXX XXXX and gave them 15 days to respond. They have yet to send me anything. 
I have also sent letters to XXXX requesting the same information and they have failed to even respond. 
This clearly indicates that TransUnion could have not validated the information and is clearly not in compliance with the credit laws. XXXX and XXXX have both sent letters admitting that they could not verify and have deleted the information from my credit file."

This would close out all graduate loans from XXXX University and leave ONLY a balance of around {$29000.00} from the University XXXX XXXX for XXXX loans. XXXX University did in fact issue a check with instructions by XXXX CFO XXXX XXXX and it was received by the DOE on or about XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I then called NelNet and asked if XXXX was paid in pull, to which the representative confirmed it had been. I then asked for options on repayment of the XXXX loans only since I was not employed. The representative said my only option was to defer payment until XXXX XXXX by assessing additional interest from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I reluctantly agreed. I then took out a vehicle loan about a month later to which I was informed I had student debt which was affecting my credit and interest rates. I thought at the time they were referring to the XXXX smaller balance. Now, a year later, I went to apply for my first home loan and was told I wil still over {$60000.00} in debt with student loans. I am not able to qualify for any type of home loans or any lines of credit due to this error. Upon investigation, it has been determined that I was never placed on a payment plan, that Nelnet assessed interest fraudulently, and then took the {$30000.00} from XXXX and has only been making the minimum payments on the interest. I spoke with XXXX, a "" manager '' from Nelnet and he said that my only options were to pay the interest balance ( which still puts me in debt around {$60000.00} ) or reverse the payment which will put all my XXXX loans into default and collections. I have proof that both Nelnet and XXXX have confirmed they are equally at fault, and that I am XXXX % blameless for these damages. I have now lost any chance of purchasing a home for the foreseeable future until this matter is resolved, and have paid thousands of dollars in additional interest in student loans, vehicle loans, and other loans that should never have been paid.

146823,Mortgage,"In XXXX 2015, I applied for a HARP XXXX refinance mortgage with XXXX with a 3.625 % no cost, locked interest rate. I was told I was approved and XXXX DID NOT require an appraisal for my home.When it came to funding, XXXX said that they would not fund my HARP XXXX Plus without an appraisal ( XXXX Plus XXXX did not require an appraisal ). I told them this to no avail. They said that they still would require an appraisal even though this is not what I was told originally. Nothing had changed concerning my home since my last XXXX refinance with XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I believe this act was against the full intent of the Harp loan. 
XX/XX/XXXX the rates where much lower for a conventional loan 3.25 % with points ( more money to XXXX ), so the loan officer told me he would switch the loan to a conventional loan since XXXX was forcing me to have an appraisal anyway, even though it is not in the XXXX guidelines. If I still wanted the loan I had to agree to the appraisal. I agreed, not knowing what else I could do since the interest rates on the open market rose dramatically. My lock was for XXXX days. After waiting XXXX weeks for XXXX to send over their approved appraiser, I was already smelling a skunk in the room. Then I received an email that the appraiser sent to XXXX that stated he was not qualified to do the appraisal!! Then XXXX said they would send another appraiser but they wanted more money to extend the loan lock even though it was their fault. 
Then after one week of me calling XXXX ( with no response ) because no appraiser had called me yet, I received an email stating that the new appraisal co. XXXX wanted more money for my appraisal {$640.00} instead of {$440.00} that I was originally quoted. I checked out XXXX reviews and they had negative XXXX stars so I requested a different appraisal company. XXXX told me that there was only one approved appraisal co. that they had that would do my appraisal. I was forced to agree if I wanted the refi. so I did. One more week passed without a call from XXXX new appraiser. No one returned my calls that the appraiser had not called yet. I finally received a call from an appraiser but he said he could not do the appraisal for XXXX weeks. I told him that I needed someone sooner. He said he would notify XXXX and they would call me or XXXX would call me to get an appraiser immediately. I did not here back from anyone. I called and emailed XXXX for XXXX more week with no answer. I finally received an email that was for more points to extend the lock again ( more money for XXXX ) .and that the appraiser was the only one approved to do my appraisal, there was n't anyone else that they had approved. I was frantic at this point so I called a few local independent appraisers, just to see if it was normal to take a month and a half to get an appraiser to ones home. I received a call back from a local appraiser the same day and was told that the mortgage co was obviously trying to delay out of lock to get a higher interest rate and that the {$640.00} was very high cost. XXXX more week later, I finally received a call from the appraiser that had originally requested an expedited appraiser. He was frustrated to hear no one else had been sent to contact me. I set an appointment with him the soonest he could do it, one week later, XXXX days before my XXXX lock would expire. I still kept calling and emailing XXXX requesting a return phone call ( XXXX weeks now with no call back ). 
I finally contacted someone at XXXX. They stated they would not extend the lock even thou it was their fault and when funded the loan cost would be at the current higher interest rates plus an additional out of lock points fee added on!

Every 3 months Wells Fargo asks us to submit paperwork including tax forms, pay stubs and bank statements. Then they do nothing. We have had many buyers and still have a buyer now. The bank is very slow and does n't do anything with the paperwork. They wait until the 3 months is up then tells us it 's expired and asks for us to submit everything again. This has been going on for seven years. Every time we call them to check on the status all we are told is that it is in process. Now we received notice that a sheriff sale is scheduled. We postpone it twice already and will end up having to go to court to fight it. This is extremely frustrating. Wells Fargo is the worst bank I have ever dealt with. I continue to get calls from them trying to collect a debt and when I explain we are in the process of a short sale I am transferred several times and the outcome is always the same. I need help getting them to actually do their job. The sad part of this whole situation is the reason we fell short on the mortgage. I had to shut down my checking account for fraudulent activity. Because my account was frozen I mailed money orders to Wells Fargo for the mortgage payment. Money orders do n't exceed {$500.00}. so I had to send XXXX money orders. A few weeks later Wells Fargo sent the money orders back in the mail and charged a XXXX late fee. I contacted them and was told that a machine opens the letters and because I had more then XXXX money order in a envelope the machine could n't process it and they had to charge a late fee. We were living paycheck to paycheck and were unable to pay the late fee in full. So every month after Wells Fargo charged another late fee onto the mortgage. We could n't afford it. Eventually we stopped paying and started the process of a short sale. Please contact me if you need proof of documents of the short sale process."

I have called several times year to procollect and the apartment community and not one person is professional enough to at least investigate the matter. This is the only negative thing on my credit, I have never made a late payment on anything. I am professional RN for 16 years and am able to pay my bills, it is the principle here not the money. The unprofessional manner of procollect and their staff is unacceptable to consumers whom do actually pay their bills on time.

I had several contacts approach me by phone on how they were upgrading my site for the world to see it. I did n't understand on what to do. I have never been in this field of marketing. I ended up paying to several companies. All I was looking for was to make an extra income to pay bills. I was approached as owning my own business and bringing in extra cash. But in order to make money I would had to pay even more money to all these companies calling me and pushing me their services as necessary to my online business. And they always call you for more money, meanwhile I kept paying for more services and they were never provided. I was losing sleep unable to think worried about how to pay off creditors. Discover denied me for the wrong reasons. I was disputing as services not rendered. And is not a billing error. I did agree to pay for their services but they never provided me with them. I tried to resolve with the company 's first but after you ask for a refund they ignored me."

By XXXX/XXXX/2016 I finally called the mortgage company and was told they had not received it, they recently had changed their mailing address according to the representative and thats probably why it was missing. They told me to put a stop payment on the check from my bank and gave me the new address to send it to. I put a stop payment on the check and changed the address in my bill pay to the new address. I had the bank resend {$27000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2016 to be received by XXXX/XXXX/2016 to Ocwen Mortgage. In the meantime I received a letter from Ocwen Mortgage with my previous check attached to it stating they were returning it because if I was paying off my Mortgage loan they needed certified funds. I immediately called Ocwen Mortgage and explained to them that it was simply a principal payment and not a payoff payment. My payoff was {$29000.00} my check was for {$27000.00}. Fast forward my new online check was to be received by XXXX/XXXX/16 and I again checked my balances daily. Finally on XXXX/XXXX/16 and still no record of my payment I contacted Ocwen Mortgage they did say that they received my payment from my bank however payoff payments were to be made by cashiers check and I again explained that it was simply a principal payment.

This is online bill pay I explained and I have been using this for the last 7 years with no problems!! Why now? Finally I was given to an escalation manager and I reexplained my story and I was told that they would take care of it and would call me Tuesday XXXX to let me know status. I received a phone call on XXXX and they left a message stating nothing had been done and they would call me in a day or XXXX.

548182,Student loan,"I have been wrestling with this loan payment since graduating in XX/XX/2008. Hindsight being what it is, I was not so subtly guided towards taking a loan out from Navient ( then XXXX ). While I have been able to temporarily reduce payments by way of forbearance or interest reduction rates, they have been just that -- temporary. What there is no transparency of or any information relating to is how temporary these "" assistance '' programs are. You are only allotted up to two years of forbearance relief before they simply tell you, "" You ca n't renew this program as you have used up your allotment '' without any warning leading up to it. The reduced rate interest programs are good for a year. You can continue to attempt to apply for them, however even if you are accepted your base monthly rate will still increase. My reduced monthly rate went up 61 % from the first year to the second. When I tried attempting to go for the third year, I was told that I make too much money, and now my monthly payments are higher than what I pay for rent. Terrible practices, not enough information, and no relief programs in sight. Borrowers beware : Never take a private loan unless you are 1,000 % certain that you are well within your means to pay it back immediately! Unless I find some relief, this will be hanging over me the rest of my life."

I made sure to pay after the ( pending ) had changed to ( posted ). 
Still, the CC applied my payment to my promotional balance instead of my new purchases ( largely voiding the interest free loan that I had paid {$80.00} for, and punishing me with unjustified interest charges ). This already seemed to have happened in XXXX ( confusing ). I had a long phone call with CHASE XXXX XXXX regarding unreasonably high interest charges. On XXXX XXXX I bought airline tickets for {$2000.00} and for {$340.00} which posted on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and I made payments for the same amounts XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, which posted on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.

I called, and after being escalateded up XXXX levels I learned that most of my payments had been applied to the 0 % promotion balance instead of the purchases ( which by then had posted and which carry a 15 % interest rate ). After a long phone conversation, I was told that this in agreement with the cardholder agreement ( backside of statement, attached ). I do not agree. The service rep told me that I have to wait for the statement period to lapse in order to have my payment be applied to the new purchase.

Also a few other smaller checks for random items, accounts, etc. On about XXXX XXXX, 2007 I finally get a XXXX Bank postcard stating my check for {$3000.00} had bounced and already began the computer 's process of double charging the overdraft fee, then the fee for that, which lead to more overdraft fees. XXXX was of no help with the problem, in fact they were "" shady '' about it. I called several times only to be mocked, laughed at, and literally called a liar. Even though copies to every check & transaction I had ever done with them was available anytime for my viewing- they refused me any information, viewing, what the large amount paid for ... NOTHING. This was all witnessed by officers at the XXXX Police Dept as my final call to XXXX about this was in front of them so they could listen. The representative mocking my call and handwriting changes his tune when a Detective took phone from me and politely tore into his unprofessional behavior and that ID theft reports had been filed ; investigations started. So there 's more but I 'll cut to where this strange collection letter comes in. For over a year now I have begun receiving NEW debt collection letters XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX behalf of a Jefferson Capital Systems , for the old, fraudulent, closed and erased from XXXX Bank 's system, debt! They have the amount of {$920.00} as the total, then proceed to coax me in by asking for a mere {$180.00} within 28 days and they 'll forgive the whole thing. BUT, there 's fine print stating that once I do acknowledge them and even offer a payment, not make a payment, but offer- that will put me back in the clear to be sued, and start the debt 's full amount over again like new! I am blown away, first off- the debt was never theirs to forgive, it was a mistake in XXXX Bank 's system, which has been completely erased therefore already forgiven, because obviously they do n't want any records of it to be accessible and do n't want to ever have it brought up- ( possibly in court or elsewhere ). A XXXX branch manager about 7 months ago searched extensively throughout their archives/database and current systems for anything on that former account with them or my name even, turn up nothing at all. Like it never existed even asked me if I was sure I banked with XXXX back then! It 's not on my credit reports, XXXX definitely is n't pursuing this and so bottom line- Who the heck do these shady negotiating debt swindlers think they are?! I 've had it with them! I will not contact them directly, as why I listed above. And I surely wo n't be paying for a debt I did n't even cause, to these people to pocket every bit of it! Which is exactly what they 'd do because why would XXXX want it? I do n't exist to them anymore. And on a side note, I 've read about the FTC already coming down on these XXXX companies for fraudulent acts, especially Jefferson Capital, so I think the FTC needs to know that the XXXX & XXXX games have n't stopped, their just changing up their strategies starting with their debt letters approach on people."

333074,Credit reporting,"I disputed the negative reporting related to XXXX on my credit report. They updated it to show as paid ( {$0.00} balance ) but still show it as a serious delinquency due to paying late. This has negatively impacted my credit score. It took us a VERY long time and a lot of work to get a final bill with detailed charges from XXXX and once we finally did we paid it within a few days. It is the creditor 's responsibility to provide the consumer the information they need to understand if the charges are valid and since we did not receive this we do not want the late/delinquency reported on our record. Here is more background. I closed my account with XXXX. They have sent me bills in the mail that only show the total amount owed but not what the charges are for. My husband and I attempted to call them multiple times as well as stop into the store to understand these charges. We were only hold for extremely long periods of time with no-one picking up the phone. In the XXXX their collection agency XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX contacted me and asked if there was anything they could do to help resolve this debt. I let them know that I wanted a bill noted as final that showed what the charges were for. They agreed to this and all I received from them was another bill that just showed the balance due ( not what it was for ) plus a collection charge. To make matters worse I noticed that my credit score dropped significantly this month so I pulled my credit report. I have NEVER had a late charge on my credit report in the XXXX years I have been an adult. XXXX reported my account as deliquent. I contacted our local non profit credit counseling agency and they suggested I first try to work with XXXX to get a final copy of the bill and also to get it removed from my credit report since they have not provided me with adequate information to understand the charges. I spent over 30 minutes on the phone with XXXX and took detailed notes. They said that they would send me the bill as I requested ( "" now '' ) but that once it went to their collection agency I would have to wait 7 years for the negative information to go away. I contested this verbally on the phone as I was never given the proper information to understand what the bill was for. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold. I waited a few minutes and they said they were connecting me to a supervisor now that would help me - no-one had picked up 7 minutes later when I finally gave up and hung up. I would like to understand what I need to do to get this negative information removed from my credit report. When they finally did send me the bill I paid it ( plus the collection fee ) in a very timely manner. However, I have a significant problem with XXXX not providing me the information to know whether the debt was valid and then reporting it as late/delinquency on my credit report. I also have major issues with being on hold multiple times to get this information without them picking up the phone. I am hoping that you can help resolve this for me.

On the day we deposited the check, our bank locations system happened to be down so we called to get an update on the status of the check. The Bank of America rep told us they would release {$100.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and the rest once the check has cleared. The entire check cleared the next morning so we called back and the rep told us it takes 3-5 days to clear and the bank could still pull the funds until then. We called back a few times and were told the same thing by different reps for the first week. The following week, a female rep informed us that it actually takes 10 days to clear and the funds could be pulled back until that time. The last rep we talked to told us that the funds had been cleared by both banks and that there was no way either bank would come back after that period of time stating the check was n't cleared. We waited until XXXX/XXXX/2016 to use any money from the check. On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I checked my bank account and it showed they were pulling the funds back out of my account and my account was now negative almost {$3000.00} from the check being pulled back and our cell phone bill still processing. The only thing it showed on my online banking account was debit/hold for {$2800.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2016. I called customer service and spoke with a man who said he did n't have any explanation on his side as well and put me on hold to get his supervisor. Neither could tell me what was going on and stated that the only thing they could do is submit the charge-back for review as high priority but I would still need to find another way to be repaid ( wire transfer, money order, etc ) for the funds that were pulled back out of my account. I do n't understand how anyone can pull funds that were verified by both banks and cleared over two months ago. We verified the check with the original bank and called Bank of America almost everyday to verify the check had cleared before we touched any funds from it. No one has an explanation and I 've been getting the run around from Bank of America since we deposited the check back in XXXX."

This so-called collection agency has sent me a letter saying my "" account '' is in arrears, yet I have obviously never had such a letter from any medical establishment.

A few weeks ago I started XXXX, and of course registered for XXXX LLC. I set my home address as the public domain address on file, and I assume these guys are trawling the Washington State XXXX database and looking for victims to extort money from. 

The letter is very vague, and I ca n't find out much about the collection agency, so I 'm not sure what the correct course of action is. I do *not* want to invoke correspondence from these guys, as many reviews online states that this is used to be able to ascertain your telephone number in order to constantly harass you.

I was then told they could n't accept the payment until after they contacted the foreclosure dept. to find out how much the legal fees amount and because it was the holidays they would send me a letter and an email the beginning of the year. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Carrington stating A Notice Default has been filed on XX/XX/XXXX."

651954,Mortgage,"In late 2015, I received a mortgage modification from Chase Mortgage. At that time the mortgage payment was set at {$850.00} and a special Chase bank account linked to the mortgage was set up for direct payroll deposit so the mortgage could never fall into arrears. Since that time, Chase Mortgage has consistently failed to debit mortgage payments from this linked account per the terms of the modification, thus causing the mortgage to fall into arrears. Now Chase is threatening to foreclose due to their own failure to comply with the terms. 

After being notified in writing about this accounting error with a NOTICE OR ERROR followed by a QUALIFIED WRITTEN REQUEST, Chase has failed to remedy the problem, and has merely responded with form letters. I even hired an attorney to send Chase a letter demanding that they fix their accounting errors, and Chase once again responded with a form letter. 

To resolve this matter to my satisfaction Chase must : *Cease and desist all foreclosure actions and threats. 
*Timely post FROM the linked bank account TO the mortgage a sum of {$850.00} on or about the due date in compliance with the terms of the modification. 
*Move any and all alleged missed payments to the end of the mortgage without the need for a full mortgage modification. 
*Notify all credit bureaus that my mortgage has been "" current '' since XXXX of 2015 and remains so."

I then tried to withdraw {$300.00} out of my local ATM the next morning after I had received clear payment, but my transaction was denied. I was very alarmed so I called paypal to find out what happened. Paypal informed me that they had associated my account with a delinquent account that was 14 years old ( my current paypal account has been in good standings without question for the last 12 years, and payapl has never tried to come after me for a delinquent account prior to this ). I informed paypal that the delinquent account did not belong to me and asked them to do a fraud investigation. They proceeded to conduct XXXX "" in-house '' fraud investigations over the next 48 hours only to inform me that they still believed it was linked to me. During all this time I have a balance of {$26000.00} which paypal is holding ransom until I agree to pay {$1000.00} for this other delinquent account. YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT, INSTEAD OF FREEZING {$1000.00} OUT OF MY {$26000.00} BALANCE THEY EXTORT ME BY HOLDING MY ENTIRE ACCOUNT RANSOM UNTIL I AGREE TO PAY THEIR CHARGES. So I reluctantly pay the {$1000.00} to gain access of my money, but I did have them note that this delinquent account still was not my account and the only reason I was paying it off was because they were making me do so to un-freeze my account. Now my account is active again for 2 days before another department of paypal freezes my account AGAIN and will not let me touch my money. The merchant division of paypal freezes {$13000.00} and tells me they are going to hold my entire account for 90 to 180 days. Mind you the buyer has already taken possession of the item ( with a florida title and registration ) so I do n't have the option to cancel the transaction. Now I 'm stuck without my item and with a frozen account for the next 90 to 180 days. I use ebay and paypal as my main source of income to provide for my family of XXXX. Now I ca n't make any sales because every penny that goes into my paypal account is frozen up to {$24000.00}. The buyer has also agreed to sign an affidavit relinquishing all of his right to come after paypal or his credit card in the future. Paypal said that wold not change anything, they still would need to hold the money for 90 to 180 days.

B of A held the payoff funds ( over XXXX ) for 6 weeks for some reason, during that time they sold the loan to XXXX who kept trying to collect mortgage payments from me saying I was behind and they were going to begin foreclosure again, the funds went missing, B of A wired the funds to XXXX with the incorrect account #, XXXX sent it back to B of A, B of A sent it to the title company, who sent it back to B of A, who sent it back to XXXX who wanted more than the payoff amount. This went on for 2 months without anyone taking responsibility for it. It was an absolute disaster. I finally found a department at B of A who would complete the transaction. No one even apologized for the incompetence. I 'm sure my experience with these big banks in not unique but I felt powerless against this system. They held my life ransom for years and I want retribution. In XX/XX/XXXX I joined a XXXX lawsuit XXXX vs B of A which is still and active suit & paid over XXXX to a firm XXXX XXXX in California who has just been shut down as fraudulent and now all of the plaintiffs are without an attorney to protect us.

153962,Mortgage,I paid off my mortgage with Nationstar Miortgage in XXXX 2015. When I called to find out what the final payment was I was informed to send a few XXXX dollars more to cover additional interest that might be due. I was sent a refund check on XXXX/XXXX/15 for {$330.00} which bounced when I deposited in my bank. I was charged a {$12.00} returned item fee by my bank. I have contacted Nationstar numerous times and was told that the check would be resent to me. Finally today I got an email from the supervisor that I spoke to who now states that someone tried to cash the check twice and that if given approval they will reissue a check. I do not understand how a financial institution can bounce a check. In addition I have not received the Satisfaction of Mortgage document which I am now told it is my responsibility to obtain. I have had numerous mortgages and I own a number of homes and have never heard of such a thing. I am always sent the document as soon as it is recorded for which a fee is charged.

After several months of no responses I filed a complaint with their corp office. I was told I had not completed all the necessary requirements and that the deadline to do so had lapsed. I pointed out in a response that had the rep responded to my emails I would have had more than enough time to do so even tho I dispute that I had not fulfilled all the requirements. The emails attached clearly show I contacted her approx. 20 days after opening the account which according to them I had 60 days to complete the requirements for the incentive. I would have had ample time to complete any additional requirements they felt I had not met. Again I strongly dispute I had not completed each requirement set forth at the time I agreed to open the account. I also I informed PNC I stopped using the account because of the rep 's and PNC 's refusal to respond to my correspondences.
271207,Consumer Loan,"Long story short my dentist referred me to a loan company to pay for some dental work ( XXXX for XXXX ) he would do for me the next day. The loan was funded for {$7000.00} to the dentist. Before the close of business that very same day I called the dentist and spoke to his staff to say I changed my mind and I did not want the to do the XXXX. The next morning I called the loan company and the loan company said they could NOT cancel the loan since the money already went to the dentist. I called the dentist office to tell them this to ask for a refund of my {$500.00} in cash I gave them the day before and they said the dentist would call me. Well he called me 3 days short of a month later and said he "" incurred some cost '' before I cancelled my appointment. He said he would cancel the loan with the loan company and give me a partial refund of my {$500.00}. This never happened. I have called his office many times since XXXX XXXX when this first started. Now the loan company is calling me to pay off the loan. I did not receive anything for this loan and I did not receive the money. My dental insurance company paid the dentist approximately {$150.00} for the examination that day, so he can not claim he received nothing for my visit that day. I received nothing that day. The loan company is calling me up to 5 times a day including Saturday and Sunday. That is the basis for the claim these collection calls are not fair, the dentist has my money, and he has now contributed or the loan company to negative information on my credit report. 
The following is a longer version with some additional information : On the morning of XXXX XXXX, 2016 my dentist, XXXX XXXX XXXX, after a brief examination, said I had a broken crown and I needed a XXXX. In fact he said I could use XXXX on the other side of my mouth. After he told me that the total cost is {$7500.00} I told him I did not have enough money. He referred me to his staff to secure a loan with the Lending Club. I signed a paper and his staff spoke to the loan company on the phone, I did not talk to them at that time. 
My initial examination was XXXX XXXX, 2016 and the loan was funded that BEFORE the procedure ... .about three weeks later I received a letter from the Lending Club saying "" sorry my loan application has been DECLINED, yet now they are calling me for payments when they gave the money to my dentist."
266113,Bank account or service,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I would like to relay an unfortunate story of my experience with TCF National Bank. It is my contention that TCF is conducting fraudulent, misleading, and deceptive practices, in transactions regarding the processing and posting of checks, and subsequent overdraft fees charged by the bank. 

I had only been a customer at TCF for about XXXX months when I decided to write my first check to a business for tree services, for {$170.00}. I was watching several times daily for the check to come thru on my online account register, as my TCF account was used on a daily basis. 

On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, at the end of the business day ( XXXX XXXX ), I checked my account balance, and saw a positive balance of {$180.00}, indicating that the check had NOT posted to my account, by the end of the business day, on XX/XX/XXXX. On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I saw that the check had posted to my balance ( both available balance and total balance ), and had brought my available balance into the negative. Seeing this, I deposited {$100.00} into the account prior to the end of the business day, and brought the balance back into the positive. In other words ; I had a positive available balance at the end of the business day on XX/XX/XXXX, and then again on XX/XX/XXXX. There was not any one day that my account was in the negative, at the end of the business day, while banking at TCF bank. Not ever. 

However, TCF apparently was desperate for their {$37.00} overdraft fee, so they decided to get creative. Even though TCF did not process the {$170.00} check until XX/XX/XXXX, they changed their records to reflect that it posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, even though it had not. When I went into the bank the day the check posted on the XX/XX/XXXX to deposit money so the check would not overdraft, the teller told me that the check had posted that day ( not the previous day ). But by XX/XX/XXXX my online account register showed that the check posted on XX/XX/XXXX, which it had not!! This is Fraud!!! My available account balance was {$180.00} at the end of the business day on XX/XX/XXXX according to TCF 's online register and the check had not posted, but the bank fraudulently changed the date on their records, to show that the check posted to my account the day prior!! 

The transaction information report that I printed off the TCF web site, showed the "" Date/Time Initiated '' as XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( curiously 1 minute before the next day ), yet it also showed the "" Date/Time Posted '' as XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, earlier in the day!! This was blatantly false, and what I consider fraud! How could the check be initiated a minute before midnight, yet posted earlier in the day? The check did not post to my account until XX/XX/XXXX, yet they cookedtheir records to show that it posted the previous day, so that they could swindle {$37.00} from me. 

On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, I went to my local TCF branch ( XXXX location ), and spoke to a rude and indifferent branch manager named XXXX. XXXX told me that even though my available balance showed a balance of {$180.00} at the end of the business day on XX/XX/XXXX, and that the check was processed on XX/XX/XXXX, it was ok for them to back date the check to the prior day, because the check was processed through the federal reserve bank, and that may not have shown up on my available balance until the next day ; thus they get to charge their overdraft fee. When I explained that I had never had an overdraft of any kind while a customer at their bank, XXXX early rolled his eyes. XXXX was rude, indifferent and extremely condescending towards me during our conversation. Needless to say, XXXX refused to waive the one and only overdraft fee that I had received while banking at TCF. This practice of backdating checks to the prior day, even though it had not posted until the following day, is straight-up fraud. At the very least, I am owed my {$37.00} back."

I called Fifth third bank to rectify. They waived the late fee and said they would work on removing the record from my credit statement. I was able to immediately make the missing balance payment and have not been late since. My credit score has been severely negatively affected by this."
423775,Prepaid card,"Issue with Card Numbers : XXXXI purchased a US Bank Visa Variable Gift cards for {$500.00} at XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX , CA ) on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and XXXX/XXXX/2015.

I tried to use the one I purchased on XXXX/XXXX/2015 on same day due to my previous card being drained by fraudsters before I used it, but it was declined saying that it was not activated. I faxed in required information for activating it. Later, when I tried to use the gift card at a XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA on XXXX/XXXX/2015, the purchase was declined. When I checked online I found that it was fraudulently used for a purchase of {$490.00} at XXXX in XXXX, CA on XXXX/XXXX/2015 while I still have the possession of my gift card. I did not even know it was activated and the funds were drained. 

I faxed all the necessary documents to US Bank. It seems like something is really wrong with these prepaid gift cards that makes it so easy for fraudulent transaction while we still have possession of the card. I would suggest everyone not to buy these US Bank Gift cards to avoid this hassle and being out of your funds for several months."

Unfortunately since my tablet had LTE, they told me I have to go through where I activated it to have it replaced. I went to XXXX and they created a service order to get me another sent out. They charged me {$20.00} for shipping and tried to tell me if I had a protection plan it would have been free. I 'm not happy about the {$20.00} shipping vs the {$7.00}. Anyway, I get my tablet and it has the same issue as the first. I go into XXXX, and I 'm hit with another {$20.00} shipping charge ( mind you it 's still under mfg warranty ). I reluctantly paid them again and waited for my new tablet. When it came in the mail, it was cracked in top right corner and bottom right corner. I go to XXXX store and yet again they tell me {$20.00}. I did n't warranty it again that time because thatwould have been {$60.00} to get a warrantied tablet working. Anyway, I decided I was done with XXXX. I called them up to cancel my services and to lay my final bill. The first person that picked up the phone was very unhelpfull, I told him I wanted to cancel my lines, yet he was very persistant to try to keep me as a customer. I refused, and that should have been the end of it. A few months later I realized that he did n't cancel my account and I have been getting billed for tablet data. I call back and the second person that helped me was very helpful, she closed my account fully and she looked over my account, and she told me my final balance. I paid for it over the phone and she told me that everything is payed for and to ignore the next bill in the mail, as todays payment would not show up. Bill shows up and gets ignored like she told me. The bill kept showing up for the same acct. They called me about it. I told them to check their records, everything was payed for. They sent me to collections, so I filed a XXXX complaint. An agent from XXXX called me to inquire on the complaint made by me, I expected him to have my information and history ready.

27851,Bank account or service,"XX/XX/XXXX I opened a bank acct with Citibank ( Citi ). A few years later I received a letter from Citi saying my XXXX promotion would end and a min. balance fee would apply to my acct. I was given a year before these changes would take effect. In XX/XX/XXXX, well before the Fed promotion was to end, I removed my money from the Citi acct, depositing it into a different bank acct ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Having withdrawn all my money from my Citi account, I logged into my Citibank.com acct to send a message requesting to close my acct. I used the internal Citi messaging system. I received a message in return explaining what I needed to do in order for my acct to close : to reply to that message with a couple additional details. I was told, having done that, my acct would be closed. I did exactly what they told me to. XX/XX/XXXX I received a fraud alert from Citi. At this point I was well under the impression my acct did n't exist. The alert let me know that Citi did not close my acct as requested and now it was being subjected to fraud attempts. I logged into my online acct. I found my acct was fully active and was being charged fees. The Fed promotion had expired and since my acct had n't been closed ( despite what I was told ) my balance of {$0.00} was being assessed min. balance fees. Along with that the Checking Plus over draft protection was kicking in to cover those fees -- those fees on an acct I was under the impression was closed. I noticed then that there was another message in my Citi message center. In short it said : whoops, we made a mistake, we actually need you to send this other response in order to close your acct. I received no phone call or e-mail. The ONLY effort they made to tell me they gave me incorrect information on how to close my acct was to send a message to the message center of the act I had been told was closed. 
I call Citi. I explained the scenario to a customer service rep ( CSR ) who forwarded me on to his supervisor. I spoke with the supervisor for a substantial amount of time. He assured me he would take care of this mishap personally and immediately. I was told the account would be put back in order and closed immediately. XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX XXXX Director Citibank N.A., asking me to pay the fees due on my acct -- the acct I had now closed TWICE. I call Citi on XX/XX/XXXX. I speak to a collections rep named XXXX who forwarded me to a CSR named XXXX. XXXX explained to me the steps needed in order to close the acct:1 ) Citi would waive the fees assessed on my acct2 ) Citi would refund the those fees back to the checking acct3 ) Citi would transfer the new balance of the checking acct into the checking plus acct, in order to get it back to its original {$100.00} and Citi would close the accts. 
However, XXXX only had permission to correct {$70.00}. She said her supervisor could take care of the rest. At this point XXXX goes back and forth a while talking to her supervisor while I stay on hold. She says that they were able to waive the fees and refund the checking acct the full amount that would be necessary to bring the checking plus balance up to {$100.00}. However, the checking acct and the checking plus acct were no longer connected to each other and the funds could n't be transferred. The XXXX accts were disconnected when the debit card was reported stolen sometime after I thought the account was closed. XXXX says I can take care of this today if I go to a branch. There are no Citi branches within XXXX miles of me. XXXX transfers me to her supervisor ( XXXX, pronounced XXXX, employee ID XXXX ). XXXX laughs at me several times, refuses to transfer me to her supervisor, and finally promises to fix everything and call me XX/XX/XXXX She would not give me a way to contact her. She never called.

I used my XXXX XXXX XXXX autopay feature to debit my account to make the payments. I have done so since XXXX without missing a payment. 

For some unknown reason the payments for four month in late 2015 months were either not sent or received. The automatic payments resumed again in XXXX without my having done anything to change their settings. Stranger still, I had a smaller loan from UAS during the same period that was paid the on the exact same day as the larger lone and we never marked delinquent. 

I believe there was a either a systemic IT failure in XXXX XXXX XXXX 's automatic payment system or a similar failure in XXXX 's receipt system. My checking account balance was more than enough to make these payments. 

I was not contacted by XXXX University, XXXX XXXX XXXX, UAS, or XXXX about the delinquent account and had no reason to believe that this account was behind. Indeed, I have not missed a payment on any credit line in the past 16 years. These missing payments from XXXX are a clear deviation from this trend. 

Moreover, as attached, my bank statements for the months in question show clearly that the payments were debited from my account on time and sent to UAS during the months in question. I have attached a screenshot of my credit report as well as bank statements that provide evidence that my account was debited for XXXX each month. 

Neither of the XXXX other major credit reporting agencies noted the account as delinquent. 

The drop in my credit score will significantly reduce my ability to take out a mortgage or loan in the future or rent an apartment. If XXXX is unwilling to make such a change, then I would like to request a refund of all debits from the allegedly defaulted account, which total to several hundred dollars."

We were told at the time that the XXXX accounts would be linked and there would n't be any charges or fees as long as we maintained our monthly balance no less than {$1500.00} in our core checking account. Since then, we have met our minimum balance requirement and maintained at least {$100.00} in our savings account as well. 
However, starting from XX/XX/XXXX, the Bank imposes a monthly charge of {$5.00} on the grounds that our savings account has less than {$300.00} even though our balance in the core checking account always far exceeds {$1500.00} and the two accounts are supposed to be linked. We challenged their unauthorized debit and were told that there was a letter of advice sent out in XX/XX/XXXX. We never receive such letter or any electronic communication from the Bank. 
Finally, the Bank agreed to refund me but for some reasons, not the full amount of the 5 months of charges. We file this complaint because we feel being misled and we do n't know how many of consumers are being treated like that. We would appreciate your prompt attention to the matter.

Every year I was offered positions in less challenging, higher performing schools but always stayed at XXXX XXXX because of my bonds with the children and ultimate promise of the loan forgiveness. By the fifth year, I was one of the most tenured XXXX and considered a resource for stability in the XXXX.

In addition, I called the prior Stafford loan servicer, XXXX, every single year to confirm I still qualified for the loan forgiveness program and every year I was reassured I did. Navient only took over the loan servicing RIGHT as it was time to apply. Navient 's excuse was they are more "" strict '' than other loan servicers ( I would say "" literal '' to the extent of being disingenuous ).

On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I was approved for American Express XXXX card with the offer of XXXX membership rewards point when I spent {$3000.00} in 3 months. I met the opening bonus of spending {$3000.00} in 3 months, and was credit XXXX membership rewards points on XXXX/XXXX/2016. My spending was way beyond {$3000.00}, and I did not violate the term and condition by buying any gift card or such. The spendings were all normal every day spending such as groceries, gas, and rent. 

On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I canceled my XXXX card. Because I realized my existing XXXX XXXX card has all the same benefit as the XXXX card, and additional benefits from XXXX dealerships. Hence, I decide to keep my XXXX XXXX card and cancel my XXXX card, because of the exact duplicate benefits. Although XXXX XXXX has a higher annual fee. 

Before attempting to cancel my XXXX card, I use American Express online chat to chat with several agents by questioning them if my opening bonus of XXXX rewards points would be craw back if I cancel my card on that day. Agents including whose names were "" XXXX '' and "" XXXX '' all insure me that once my points were credited to my account, they wo n't be taken away. I had taken screenshots of our conversation to prove their sayings.

Although the benefits of the card are exactly covered by my existing XXXX XXXX card, and my XXXX XXXX card even provides a greater benefit. 

However, I received a physical letter from American Express dated on XXXX/XXXX/2016, informing me that my request to reinstate my Platinum card has been declined. The reason for their decision being XXXX or more of my charge accounts has a spending limit. So even though I want to do American Express good by paying them an annual fee on an inferior card that I wo n't use, they decided to decline my request ( or kindness in my opinion ). 

On XXXX/XXXX/2016, my rewards program showed a "" Point Adjustment '' of negative XXXX rewards points. I called membership rewards phone number on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on the same evening at XXXX to inquiry of the point adjustment I see. XXXX ( employee ID XXXX XXXX understood my concern, verified my account, and was confused by the reason and situation as to why my points got craw back.

XXXX then opened a case for in and insured me an agent or supervisor would contact me in XXXX7 business days. But until today, I still have n't received any phone call from American Express. 

Therefore, I decided to open this complain to bring in American Express ' attention. Through the years using American Express, I have experienced exceptional customer service. I am sure this matter could be resolved smoothly as usual, although there were some hiccups. 

Looking forward for your response.

I have paid the XXXX {$2200.00} on XXXX for Docket # XXXX. The payments, including all principal, interest, late charges, penalties and assessments, have reduced my account balance to XXXX which closed the account. There should be no further effort to enforce or collect on this account and, therefore, I am requesting that the XXXX follow through with a Vacatur of Judgment, withdraw and/or expunge Docket # XXXX from every county court ( s ). Additionally, when I paid the excess unemployment amounts, XXXX guaranteed to have this judgment removed from all XXXX credit bureaus. They have failed to do so."

Therefore my account was in forbearance and payments were not due at this time. However, I have called XXXX and emailed numerous times to get this matter resolved.

This was due to the fact my mother is a single parent, my father does n't help, and I was still looking for a full time job out of school. I tried for almost a year to get my payments adjusted due to my income and my mother 's ( she was the cosigner ). My payments were over XXXX dollars and neither her nor I could live a normal life with these payments. They wanted us to live like Hermats under a rock. I kept getting told that my income was enough to cover. I was making XXXX a year at this time. My mom XXXX. At the end of our expense calculations, both of us were close to coming even for the month after paying this rediculous loan.. Nowhere near the income for an over {$500.00} a month payment. They were close to {$700.00}. But nope, Navient still states that we had to pay because technically, we could cover if. Am I not supposed to live my life? My mother was told maybe she should "" cut back on strenuous and extravagant spending. '' My mom is a XXXX and does not spend where she does n't need to. We were appalled. I wanted to make payments, I wanted to repay Navient. I just could n't do close to {$700.00} a month. They would not work with me.

I have a federal loan and a loan from my college as well as this. They did n't care. After almost A YEAR of trying, we finally got them lowered, but still at {$300.00} a month.

I have no clue if I will be able to keep these payments. These people do not care about their customers, all they care about is getting their money at any cost. Like I stated above, I told each representative many times that I do want to pay you back. Just please work with me on a payment plan. And each time I was told "" you signed an agreement, sorry.

709985,Consumer Loan,"Harley Davidson Finance AKA XXXX XXXX is not computing their so-called simple interest contracts using the same formulas which change month to month in order to charge more interest to consumers. 
Additionally, XXXX is holding payments from consumers and posting them later in order to collect a larger per diem interest rate which makes them more profits and lengthens contract terms to their benefit. It also costs consumers more over the life of the loan in interest. 

My billing on XXXX/XXXX/15 based on my interest rate of 12.99 which is basically legal loansharking which SHOULD account for a reduced daily per diem because of a reduced principal balance per the statement states:XX/XX/2015Payment $ XXXXInterest $ XXXXPrincipal : $ XXXXXX/XX/2015Payment $ XXXXInterest $ XXXXPrincipal $ XXXXXXXX claims although the daily per diem interest costs should decrease my interest costs have increased which is the opposite of how so-called simple interest loans operate.

656952,Student loan,"American Education Services uses deceptive practices in dealing with borrowers. I just learned yesterday that they have been charging me late fees every month for the past year-and-a-half because they claim that I missed a payment, and so every payment since then, though on-time, has been deemed late. When I asked if they would waive these fees, they said they ca n't because they are "" rolling late fees. '' They also never resolved an issue I discovered about 2 years ago, when I learned that they had had me on an interest-only plan until XX/XX/XXXX, even though I had requested to be on a level plan. 

Below is a complaint I posted on the Consumer Affairs website in XXXX XXXX : I consolidated my loans at 4.75 % before graduating with an XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Since XXXX, I have been making monthly payments on my loans. Originally the lender was XXXX XXXX XXXX, but apparently AES acquired the loans in XXXX, XXXX when XXXX went out of business. I am concerned about several issues : I am charged late fees often, but without sufficient warning that my bill is due and that late fees will apply. These late fees are {$20.00}. XXXX had not served such high late fees. Also, AES is reporting these late payments to the credit report agencies, diminishing my credit - despite the fact that I pay monthly. I also frequently pay a greater sum than the minimum due - sometimes several times as much. I am concerned that these higher payments are not being applied toward the principal amount of my loan and I am not sure where the money is being applied. 

I estimate that I have paid at minimum {$20000.00}, likely {$25000.00}, to these XXXX lenders ( XXXX and AES ) over the past seven years. Yet my principal amount due has only decreased by about {$3000.00}. Though I have sometimes been on the interest-only plan, I have requested to be on the level plan for years. Yet I was just informed that I was on the interest-only plan until XXXX XXXX. Even if I were on an interest-only plan, at 4.75 % interest rate, this does not add up. Where has this money gone? On XXXX XXXX, I requested a full payment history from AES, including payments from XXXX, going back to XXXX. As of XXXX XXXX, I still have not received this payment history. I called AES on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX and was told that the request is "" being processed '' and that I should have it by Friday, XXXX XXXX."

I asked him about the debt that I owed and he said that there was mail that went to my house and I never responded to it. I never got a letter from his company and didnt throw anything away. He stated that it was sent and that he could not get me any paperwork showing what I owed as he would have to file a judgement against me in order to obtain that paperwork. He gave me the file number for the case and said that if I wanted to call the company that it came from I would need to get ahold of them and find the original paperwork. I did get a hold of them and they dont have record of it as it was over 5 years ago. He keeps telling me that it is going to cost me a lot of time and money to resolve this. I am confused as to why I would be taken to court over something that is 10 years old, and over something that he can not and will not provide paperwork on. He has called me 7 times in the past week and before then everyday even after I spoke with him about the debt. I told him I was not familiar with the XXXX.

130588,Consumer Loan,"Ally financially made a billing error. This is a non-valid debt. We have been fighting with them for 3 years to get this corrected. My husband 's lease ended in 2013.

Our buyout quoted price from Ally was {$16000.00}, XXXX XXXX ( dealership ) paid Ally {$16000.00} for the vehicle. The dealership assured us we would not be responsible for anything further ( as did Ally ). For some reason Ally still sent us a bill about a month later for over mileage ( even though this vehicle was purchased by the dealer and not returned to Ally ). We have been going rounds with them to get this corrected. I even filed a XXXX report with them in 2013 where a manager responded and assured me it would be removed. However it never was."
683999,Mortgage,"During the purchase of our home, we completed and finalized a mortgage loan with UAMC. After it was finalized, UAMC realized they made an error and could not sell the loan to a XXXX party. They then asked us to please do them a favor and refinance the loan. UAMC would cover all expenses so we would have no out of pocket fees and then they would be able to sell the loan. I was told in writing, numerous times, that we would not have to come out of pocket for ANYTHING. 

On the day we were to sign the papers, the notary told us we owed {$1600.00}. Prior to signing anything, we called the loan officer because this was not what we agreed to. We realized at that time, the money calculation broke down to {$1300.00} in prepaid interest and {$300.00} because the new loan did n't cover the entire old loan. The loan officer said he would send us a personal check for {$300.00} and he would call his manager about the other charge, noting the notary could only take a max check for {$1500.00}. The loan officer called us back within 5 minutes saying we still needed to pay the interest charge but they would drop the total to {$1500.00}, so we could give Escrow a check. 

Later that evening, I pulled up the Cash to Close agreement and noticed the LENDER agreed to pay the prepaid closing costs. Yet again, I was reminded that I was to have "" no out of pocket expenses ''. I emailed the loan officer a copy of the Cash to Close agreement that night, notifying them if I do n't get a full refund I would be retracting the loan document within the 3 day window, as per our contractual rights. The loan officer got back to me saying they agreed and would issue a full refund. They notified me and Escrow hours before I could pull the loan, a refund check was being submitted so that I was paying nothing out of pocket. I trusted UAMC and allowed the loan to go through while waiting for my refund. 

Additionally, UAMC failed to timely process, approve and notify us of their intent to close on the mortgage loan. This caused delay in completion of the close process and UAMC has attempted to charge us late fees and interest in the amount of {$410.00}. This incompetence and ineptitude is mind boggling. This is incorporated into the total funds owed of {$850.00}. In an attempt to solve this matter on my own, I have emailed the loan officer 's manager to see if she could rectify the problem, but she has n't responded to my email. 

I have only received XXXX check from this ordeal in the amount of {$640.00}. I paid {$1500.00} out of pocket, thus I am still owed a total of {$850.00}. When I notified the loan officer about the incorrect refund, he followed up with an email to me and escrow, stating again, I was to pay nothing ; could we get a copy of the final HUD. A while later, I was notified I would not be getting my full refund because there was a {$760.00} difference in the old loan and new loan and paying that to us would be a violation. They agreed that they would send me a check for {$82.00} ( which I have never received ). To this day, I have never been told nor am I aware of the reason why the new loan would not cover the whole amount of the old loan. This behavior and negligence has caused significant hardship and mistrust, as we have dealt with matter unnecessarily for their sole benefit to sell this loan for their own financial gain. In the end, my family was the loser in this and your assistance is needed to help right the wrong that my family ( the consumer ) has faced."

I 'm now on the phone again with them and on hold. As I sit here and wait, I started reading reviews on XXXX. Every single review is the same as mine. This is ridiculous!! I have spent hours on the phone with them, and they have my money!!! This company needs to be looked into. It seems to be common practice for them. How can they receive money and not investigate where it goes when it has an incorrect loan # on it. There is only XXXX address associated with the account. I just got off the phone and they once again said they have escalated the issue to a supervisor and they will get back to me in 3 days. I 've been told this before and nothing has happened.

I called Conn 's, they sent someone to check the TV. It could not be fixed. Through XXXX, I was able to work things through. I was told to go the store here in XXXX to get my TV. When I went to the store, I was told the TV was discontinued and could not get it anywhere else. They told me I had a little over XXXX to get a TV. As I looked for something that would be acceptable, the salesmen where trying to convince me to buy something bigger. I picked a TV that was less than was given. The difference in price which I expected to be applied back to the account, the manager denied. 

I waited to get the TV, The TV they brought was not in a box and rapped in plastic paper. "" for protection '' I asked him what was that, he said it was the TV I picked. I was informed that TV was also discontinued and that was the TV on the floor. I told him I was not going to take that TV home and left. 

Through many calls to XXXX, I decided to get the replacement TV. A different salesman helped me. I picked one and went to get the paperwork done. I was informed by the salesman that in order for the TV to work I needed a special cable which cost quite of bit but they had this package which included the cable and the mounting kit to put the TV on the wall. I said ok. 

AS THE SALESMAN WAS DOING THE PAPERWORK, I TRIED TO PAY IN CASH FOR THE MOUNTING KIT AND HE SAID HE COULD NOT TAKE THE MONEY. NOT ONCE HE SAID IT WAS A NEW ACCOUNT. AT THAT TIME HE INFORMED ME EXTRA CHARGES AS ADDED TO THE ACCOUNT WHICH INCLUDED INSURANCE FOR THE DURATION OF THE LIFE OF THE ACCOUNT IN CASE THE ITEMS WERE STOLEN AND OTHER CHARGES. HE SAID IF I HAD HOME OWNER 'S INSURANCE, I WOULD BRING IT TO THE STORE AND THE EXTRA CHARGES WOULD BE TAKEN OUT. I TOLD HIM WAS NOT AWARE THEY DID THAT. HE INFORMED ME IT IS ALWAYS DONE.

We also feel obligated to advise you that, in the event a judgment is awarded in our client 's favor, our client would look for evidence that would pierce your corporate entity veil, and enter litigation against you personally and all other potential principals, successors and affiliates. In doing so, our client would look at the comingling of the business assets with those of the individual principals. Additionally, our client would examine the reality of the corporate existence as evidenced by the keeping of minutes and other corporate records. Our client would explore the possibility of an obvious inadequacy of working capital, and would also determine the number of non-functioning officers and/or directors. The possibility of non-payments of dividends would be investigated, possibly coupled with payment of substantial salaries or other forms of payments to dominant shareholders. Our client would also look at all of your expenses to determine if your business was paying your personal expenses, such as excessive meals, travel, cell phone bills and automobile expenses and the legitimacy of employment of family members. Our client will seek Attorneys ' Fees against you for having to engage in any post judgment proceedings. 

In the event a judgment is entered against you, our client will engage in every method of post judgment remedies to recover the amounts owed. This will include, but not be limited to, the freezing of accounts, debtor examinations, levying against your real and personal property, and filing citations against any and all parties you transact business with. Our client will trace funds and if our client finds that you have transferred assets in violation of Fraudulent Conveyances Act, it will seek to have these assets re-conveyed to you and sold to satisfy the judgment. If you are directly involved in another business which is not in your name, our client will investigate the business thoroughly and seek to have the business re-titles in your name and sold to satisfy the judgment. Our client will record a Memorandum of Judgment against you and it will negatively affect your credit, making it more expensive and difficult for you to borrow money.

My wife, XXXX XXXX, and I, XXXX XXXX ( both of us have this credit card ) called them about two months ago to see why we were n't getting the promised credit. We were told that it was a mistake and were given a partial credit for previous charges for the extra 5 %. I recently noticed that for the last two months we were again only being paid the 1 %. The reason, they said American Express changed their policy. Grocery stores that have gas stations no longer are eligible for the 6 % credit. Since XXXX XXXX has gas stations at their stores, that makes the grocery purchases not eligible for the American Express 6 % credit. I explained to them that our local grocery store at XXXX does not have a gas station. They responded that since some of the XXXX XXXX stores do have gas stations that that is how they code all XXXX XXXX stores.

459106,Mortgage,"Our firm, XXXX XXXX, was hired by the Borrowers to investigate possible errors committed by their mortgage servicers, previously XXXX and now Carrington Mortgage Services. The Borrowers were approved for a loan modification XX/XX/XXXX that brought their payments down to {$1300.00}. The modification agreement stated all past due amounts including taxes, insurance, and any other fees past due, would be added to the unpaid principal balance. Less than 3 months later, the Borrowers were sent a notice informing them their monthly payment was increasing to {$1600.00} effective XX/XX/XXXX due to an escrow shortage. If the past due taxes and insurance were capitalized into the new principal balance amount as the modification agreement stated, there should not have been an escrow shortage and there should not have been that significant of an increase in their monthly payment. 
After receiving the notice of payment increase, the Borrowers contacted XXXX several times over a short period of time to determine the precise amount of their escrow deficiency so that they could pay the amount and lower their payment back to what it was supposed to be according to the modification agreement. Each time they spoke to someone at XXXX they were given a different figure amount that needed to be paid with no explanation as to why the amount was fluctuating. Due to their ongoing frustration, they hired our firm to investigate what they actually owed and why their payment had increased shortly after they modified their loan. 
We hired a forensic accountant to analyze the modification and the loan 's transaction history. In said analysis, it was determined XXXX never capitalized any amounts other than past due interest into the post modification principal balance, which was the cause of the large escrow deficiency and improper payment increase. Moreover, the transaction history showed XXXX did attempt to correct its error by posting a payment to the account that was then credited to the corporate advance and escrow balances in an attempt to bring the payment back to what it should have been. However, XXXX failed to perform an updated escrow analysis after posting said credit/ payment and the account was still inaccurately showing the increased payment amount as due every month. Throughout this process, the client continued to make the modified payment amount each month, which was being placed into suspense each month and led to XXXX charging excessive late fees monthly. 
Additionally, XXXX finally performed another Escrow Analysis that found the Borrower 's escrow account actually contained a surplus however, they refused to disburse the funds due to the delinquency of the account, which was caused by their failure to properly process the modification and conduct an updated escrow analysis in the first place. The most recent escrow analysis conducted by XXXX was dated XX/XX/XXXX and states the monthly mortgage payment for the last year was {$1300.00} however ; XXXX was claiming the Borrowers owed {$1600.00} on the monthly mortgage statements. Then, conveniently the loan was transferred to a new servicer, Carrington Mortgage Services, who is now attempting to claim the Borrowers owe several months of back payments for the inaccurate amount of {$1600.00}. When the issue was presented to Carrinton, they claimed there was nothing that could be done because it was the past servicer 's records. And when XXXX was notified of its errors, it claimed there was nothing that could be done since the servicing rights have been transferred to Carrington."

277012,Payday loan,"On XXXX XXXX, I applied for a {$270.00} loan from Rapid Cash ( Speedy Cash ). It was approved and the confirmation stated that funds would be deposited in my bank account early the next morning, XXXX XXXX. I meant to check at work but I became extremely busy. Since I do not have Internet access at home, I visited the local library to check my bank account. The bank showed that I was overdrawn and no deposit. I visited the website and checked the funding date. It was after XXXX. PST and it still stated that funds would be deposited Thursday, XXXX XXXX. There was a link to change the funding option. I debated this option and since I did not want to incur a return or overdraft charge with my bank, I changed the funding option to "" pick up at store '' but sent a message to the company telling them of my annoyance with the situation. 
Thoroughly annoyed at having to take this extra step to get the money I needed, I left the library at XXXX and ran up to the XXXX XXXX store to pick up my money. I explained the situation to the staff, gave them the confirmation number I had received from the website and then waited. I asked if I could put part of the money on my existing loan balance of {$87.00} then they asked if I wanted to take out another loan. I said no, all I wanted to do was get the money that was supposed to be put in my bank account this morning but was n't and that I was going to use a portion of the {$270.00} on the {$87.00} existing loan. They said that I could n't do that. I said never mind. I can do it online at another time. I just wanted the money and I wanted if before my bus came because I would have to wait another half-hour for the next one. I was also concerned about defraying the overdraft charge because the funds were not in my account when promised. 
I deposited the funds they gave me that night, XXXX XXXX, and kept in mind that they had told me there was a hold on a portion of the funds. I figured that when it cleared, I would be able to pay a portion of the existing loan. I called to check my bank account and since I had an automatic payment of {$120.00}, I did n't think anything was wrong. My bank also made a few automatic withdrawals to cover fees on another account so I could n't tell that anything was wrong. I was going to go to the library after work on Friday XXXX XXXX but it was XXXX that day and my bus was late. The heat was getting to me so I went straight home. 
I went to the library on Saturday, XXXX XXXX to make a payment on the {$87.00} loan with Rapid Cash. It was then that I found that I had another {$200.00} loan on my account with a due date of XXXX XXXX. I changed the due date of both loans to reflect XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectively so that I would n't get an automatic withdrawal for the full amount because I need to make a rent payment. I sent them a note explaining that I could n't pay {$400.00} on that date because I needed to make a {$300.00} payment on my rent or else I would be homeless. I also need to make a XXXX dollar payment on my electric and I have some other bills to pay. 
My issue is this : I did n't ask for a second loan. I thought the money I got on the night of XX/XX/XXXX was the money from the loan I applied for. After all, when asked if I wanted another loan I said no. I wanted the money that was supposed to be deposited in my account this morning which was not. One of the clerks said she would make a note of the confusion. I did n't get either of their names, they were not wearing them or they were not visible and I was in a hurry. 
I will pay back the money but I would like some leniency on the part of Rapid Cash because I had not intended to take that second {$200.00} loan. I had only wanted the money that I had initially applied for. The error was clearly not on my part. The money was not there when it should have been. I also do not feel that I should pay any fees."

I have read terrible things online about this debt collector, especially that they try to collect on debts that are not existent. I have received many scam phone calls and letters over fake debt in the past, so I am very careful. I have called this company repeatedly and there call center is outsourced to XXXX. The representatives do not listen, they just keep repeating the account number and the debt amount due. It is my full intention to pay this debt and have offered so to this company. I am the one calling the debt collector trying to pay the debt off. I did not have a payment plan with them and I have made XXXX payments to them since I received their first letter.

When I spoke them today, XXXX/XXXX/15, for the second time, ( put on hold and transferred to multiple people for over 45 minutes on each call ) they said they do not report late payments, but I am looking at my credit reports with the XXXX bureaus saying they stated the above. My credit went down XXXX points overnight from them hitting my account besides the initial hit on the original debt from Barclays. Please help I am trying everything and paying these people at the same time. They are reporting derogatory to my credit every 2 weeks which I can see since I have credit monitoring. On today 's phone call they said they would send another report to the bureaus which would still say the same thing about being past due and I am not past due. I must not be the only one this is happening to. I am so distraught, I am pregnant and we are trying to buy a house and this debt collector has free reign to do whatever they want with my credit while I am paying them. This has to be against the law."
710961,Credit reporting,"I have been fighting with these people for years, they had me living in a state I have never lived in and reported non payment when I paid off credit cards or loans. Most of this had to do with a construction project that XXXX Bank stole {$150000.00} of my money which I am still trying to recover. Judgements placed because they controlled all the money and lost it. Also illegal services I found on a loan which they would not remove. I also tried to get a loan and had my identity stolen which these people must have tried to use to get more money. I did refuse to pay them and told them I am entitled to my report and their scores are very unbalanced and discriminating. They refused to do anything so I had my score frozen for three months which with their inaccurate reporting made it impossible to get a loan. It if time they stopped the inaccurate reporting and also used XXXX credit card my father had which had a second card in my name I never used. They refused to verify that my signature was on those documents so when he passed I settled for less which hurt me because he was not here. Something must be done with these people and inaccurate reports when it says a soft hit does not affect your score it does. They use everything. Someone needs to come up with some kind of system. There were also credit cards that I myself did not close but did not use so they showed also which should not be reported because I did not use them I guess they close them in a certain amount of time."

It is not right to just have any random person decide to place any alleged debt to another person 's credit report. This alleged debt appeared as a debt on my credit report with no prior checks, controls, verifications, or filtering by neither the collection agency or the Credit Bureaus.

186059,Mortgage,"In XXXX 2016, our home in Louisiana flooded. We have flood insurance but our mortgage company will not disperse the funds because we are self contracting our home. With this disaster there in limited qualified contractors available and my husband has been in the construction field for over 25 years. It would be senseless to pay someone to repair our home when we can do it and do a better job. The State of Louisiana law states a person can self contract their own home from the ground up or remodeling, one home in a years time. My mortgage company, Capital One, is telling us we can not do our own repairs. We have already started our repairs even before we received our insurance check. We were not going to let our home sit to grow mold. I have gotten so many different stories from Capital One that I do n't even know what the truth is? I was told that XXXX is the reason we can not self contract but what is funny to me is, we did a conventional loan, we did n't do a government funded loan. How can XXXX tells us what we can do? Just yesterday I get another call from Capital One telling me that XXXX wants letters of recommendation from people who have seen my husband 's construction skills. This call comes AFTER we were told we could not self contract!! On XXXX XXXX, we called for an inspection. The inspector came out and told us we were at 40 % with our repairs and we have yet to receive a check. I told the representative who called yesterday for my husband 's references to look at the XXXX pictures the inspector took of our home to see if he is qualified to do repairs she did n't have a response. My husband and I have been paying for the repairs out of our savings, just so we can get our family back in our home. We are running out of money!!! I have pleaded with Capital One and still no results. I can not understand how a company can have control over OUR INSURANCE MONEY? We pay our insurance premiums and we can not have OUR money?? 
By the way we did hire a painter contractor, paid them some money and have n't seen him since. This is why so many people in Louisiana have chosen to self contract. Contractors flew into Louisiana to prey on the flood victims, this is a disgrace and so is Capital One for not giving us our money to complete our repairs."

This property includes a newly constructed home. We began the application process with loan originator XXXX XXXX, and completed the necessary paperwork with a loan processor who requested identical income and tax information multiple times, and requested my online password in order to access my account. When I declined to provide my password and asked to speak with a supervisor, she said she would return my call. I subsequently learned that she had left PennyMac 's employ. After several more phone calls and many weeks, we received notice that we had been rejected for the loan because of inadequate income, however, the loan processor had miscalculated our income by nearly {$2000.00} per month. We requested and received a refund for the property appraisal fee of {$320.00} which we had paid to PennyMac with our application. XX/XX/XXXX, we were contacted by XXXX XXXX ' supervisor, XXXX XXXX, who reviewed our original application and assured us that the loan processor had made a mistake and we did, in fact, qualify for the new loan, which represented only 40 % of our property 's appraised value. We provided the appraisal, done only weeks earlier with our construction loan, however, we were told that PennyMac required their own appraiser and that we should restart the loan process with another {$320.00} appraisal fee. XX/XX/XXXX, we paid the fee again and re-submitted paperwork to XXXX XXXX. We were told that he would be working with the underwriting department directly and that the loan should close within 30 days. Instead, we kept getting more requests for additional financial information previously provided. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, after more stalling and no response to our emails or calls, I learned that PennyMac had, without authorization, run my credit again, resulting in a significant drop. This inquiry was NOT authorized, and in fact, I told XXXX XXXX when we spoke by phone that if it was necessary to run our credit again to resubmit the loan application, I would not be proceeding He assured both us that the credit information PennyMac received in XXXX would be sufficient After learning that my credit was damaged and the loan was still in limbo, I called XXXX XXXX asked that the loan be cancelled and all monies refunded He sent an email saying the {$320.00} would be refunded. I have yet to see it and I have followed up with emails to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, without response since XX/XX/XXXX. It appears that both may now have left PennyMac.

I have lots of medical issues and I also pay lots for medical coverage to cover those issues. I keep credit monitoring in order to monitor the accounts and the activity and XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed XXXX new collections show up on my credit report and I was totally clueless as to where they came from because I have NEVER received anything pertaining to these accounts and the amounts where even wacky because they did n't match any of my dedictibles etc. That being said I sent a letter to the this one collection agency claiming to have all of my accounts and they responded with a list of dates of service and amounts but no where on there did it give me an itemization nor did it show me that my insurance was or was n't billed but instead it shows that all XXXX charges are from the same date of service and the same and same department of the hospital. I first of all find that hard to believe because I do n't understand why there would be XXXX seperate bills for the same day with the same department. I would think those would be linked together somehow all on one bill. I work in the medical industry myself and I hope my company does n't ever do business this way but when the company responded they also stated that they had sent me previous notification and I 've never received anything until I requested more information due to it popping up out of nowhere. Not only that but I found it super unfair that the date of service is from XX/XX/2015 and the hospital never sent anything but yet turned it over to a collection agency 4 months or less from the date of service. I go to this hospital on a regular basis and never once was it mentioned that I had an outstanding balance and they usually bill my insurance the correct way. Well after working 75 hours this week and taking care of my children because I 'm a single mom and dealing with my illnesses, I finally made myself sit down and contact the hospital original furnisher of the information and only to find out that the lady did n't have my insurance information correct in their system so my insurance was never billed. When I asked for the account to be removed due to this error I was told I would have to ride it out and that it could take up to 45 days for the insurance claim to be filed etc. This is not OK with me as I am again trying to do my part to take care of my debt but yet collection agencies are allowed to do whatever they want with no reprocutions. If I expect any sort of response, I have to pay an arm and and a leg to have my mail sent certified so that I can ensure they will respond but collection agencies can just simply state they sent you the letter they are supposed to before reporting the debt and I 'm supposed to take their word even though I know I check my mail everyday and I never received anything from anyone. The fact of the matter is I was never sent the appropriate letter giving me 30 days to dispute the validity and had I been the documentation I would 've looked further into it because I would 've figure dout there was some sort of billing error in the beginning."

We are fearful that Chase Mortgage is going to foreclose on his home that he & my mother worked so hard, for so many years to acquire. Because of his failing health, both XXXX and now XXXX, I have stepped in to try and help now that Chase has refused to do so. 

My father is Veteran of the XXXX XXXX but things like that do n't matter to Chase, I guess. We have been trying month after month to submit documentation to them with no success at all. Violation of The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( Regulation X ) 1024.41 Loss mitigation procedures. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established rules to "" protect mortgage borrowers from costly surprises and runarounds by their servicers. '' I can not tell you how many times we have faxed and re-faxed the same documents. They asked for the XXXX countless times which we sent in, which is merely a document to obtain copies of the homeowner 's tax return. Why do we have to send the same document over and over? 1024.41 ( b ) Receipt of Loss Mitigation application - "" A servicer shall exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information to complete a loss mitigation application. '' It is also disturbing that along with the obvious mishandling of servicing this mortgage by Chase, that the current interest rate of 8.25 % is prejudicial and predatorial. Dodd-Frank : Title XIV - Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act 15 U.S.C. 1602 ( Dodd-Frank Act 1431 ) Subtitle C : High Cost Mortgages, High cost mortgages include first mortgages with an interest rate that is more than 6.5 % higher than the average prime offer rate, or a second mortgage with an interest rate more than 8.5 % higher than the average prime offer rate, as well as other enumerated definitions. When interest rates are now at XXXX & 4 %, why must he suffer from a sub-prime interest rate at over double the current rate? 

He is now at the point where he feels so beaten down by numerous account managers and being talked down to because he does n't understand all that is being said to him ; he feels like Chase is purposely steering his mortgage into foreclosure. XXXX Continuity of contact - "" Servicers are required to maintain reasonable policies and procedures with respect to providing delinquent borrowers with access to personnel to assist them with loss mitigation options ''. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act FDCPA 806, Harassment or abuse 15 U.S.C. 1692d - Chase has been very condescending and short when communicating with my father. I do n't understand why Chase feels the need to talk down to him or make him feel stupid or like a deadbeat homeowner. 

He also was n't given a written reason for denial or a chance to appeal that decision. 1024.41 41 ( h ) Appeal process. Paragraph 41 ( h ) ( 3 ) Supervisory personnel. The appeal may be evaluated by supervisory personnel that are responsible for oversight of the personnel that conducted the initial evaluation, as long as the supervisory personnel were not directly involved in the initial evaluation of the borrower 's complete loss mitigation application. 

I am pleading for someone to step in and help us get his mortgage situation back on track. If he could only get a decent interest rate with a decent payment amount, get the unpaid payments put on the back of the loan and give him a fresh start then he could make his monthly payments for as long as he remains alive in his house. Please someone help us.

I was not informed that I did not qualify for the ( conventional ) mortgage I applied for until after the mortgage commitment date was due! Even my realtor, XXXX, had trouble getting XXXX to keep in regular contact. On the day of the mortgage commitment he had to hear from XXXX boss, XXXX, about why there was no mortgage commitment from the bank on the day due! 
I applied for a conventional mortgage to move to a different house in the same neighborhood but was told, after passing the mortgage commitment date, that for the loan to still move forward it would have to change to an investor mortgage. The reason given being the loan may not pass Fannie Mae rules, rules that the loan officer claimed he had not and could not have had any knowledge of, despite working the industry for 20 years, closing about XXXX loans a year, and had all my information from a previous closing in which he could have asked underwriting before getting me to sign the application! 
Afterwards, I filed a formal complaint with XXXX with the Office of the Chairman who promised a thorough investigation but came back saying Citizens did nothing wrong. She claimed the loan officer properly informed me about why my application could not be approved. The bank is basically lying and trying to walk back their mistake because I clearly told the Office of the Chairman - with evidence - that the loan officer did not communicate any problems or issues with my application until after the mortgage commitment deadline was passed. They wanted to change what type of mortgage I was applying for, all after the fact, when they should have know prior to formally applying that my application could not be approved! It was very clear that the bank should not have attempted to sell an application since they had information available that it could not be approved, especially to a long time customer.The bank, especially the loan officer, did not act in the best interests of the customer as they charged me for unreserved services."
769431,Debt collection,"I have received phone calls from Premier Recovery Group ( XXXX ) XXXX at my place of employment. The first time it was an extremely rude gentleman on the phone who I kindly requested to not call my place of employment. He stated "" that does n't work for him '' and continued to harass me about when I would pay him so I had to hang-up. A few days later I received a call from the same company while at work, but this time it was a woman stating she was told by her coworker that I wanted her to call me back while I was working so I could give her my information to give her money. I told the woman that was false and asked her to please not call me at work - she continued to get increasingly harassing so once again I had to hang-up. The same woman called right back to my place of employment and proceeded to tell my coworker who answered the phone that she is sending paperwork to garnish my wages from my paycheck because I wo n't pay her and asked my coworker for the office fax number. I have asked Premier Recovery Group on multiple occasions to not call my work and now they are telling my coworkers I owe debts and they are going to garnish my wages. My boss caught wind of what was going on and now he wants to know why somebody is repeatedly calling the office and threatening to garnish my wages. Premier Recovery Group has crossed the line in several different ways. Premier Recovery Group CAN NOT disclose personal information to my coworkers about personal debt or say they are going to garnish my wages nor can they continue to call a professional business when they have been told not to contact me at my place of employment more than once."

I have never missed a payment in my life and have excellent credit before this. As a consumer, I felt PNC Mortgage is at fault for not informing me about the transition, and they just do n't care. 

To make matter worse, I had file a complaint with Better Business Bureau, they acknowledge that it happens because I did not receive their letters, can not prove that they call me, text me or email me, but offer nothing to help me.

443935,Mortgage,"Once I made an offer on a house and started the home buying process on or about XXXX XXXX 2015, with a projected closing date of XXXX XXXX 2015, it has been a steady dose of the highest level of incompetence from a major corporation that is Wells Fargo. Granted the house is a manufactured home, and I am a first time home buyer using my VA home loan benefit. We did n't make the XXXX XXXX date as the bank found a typo on the title paperwork and without notice, extended the closing date out until the XXXX of XXXX. I was n't notified and found out later from my realtor, who got the typo fixed in just a few days. As the XXXX approached, the bank came up with some other excuse and it was again delayed, with no future date established. 
Wells Fargo throughout this process has requested documents which have been provided in a timely matter. One example is the water test submitted on XXXX XXXX, on XXXX XXXX we are told by the bank that it must be retaken. At some point in XXXX, Wells Fargo mentioned that they would need to have an engineer inspect an addition built on the home, and that they would take care of that. Yesterday, XXXX XXXX we are told that the inspection still needs to be performed. 
These are only XXXX examples of how weeks after the original closing date had come and gone, and being told several times that we are just waiting on this form, only to have them request something more. They continue to blame the VA for having strict requirements, which I know is a fact. However, once several weeks, or even literally MONTHS into the process, the VA did n't invent new requirements. 
Once the original closing of XXXX XXXX was blown by Wells Fargo, I see no reason why they were unable to look at the entire package, and determine what was still missing. 
More than 2 months after starting this, I was asked to provide documentation on asmall monthly deposit into a checking account that had been there from day one. Why after 2 months are they only now asking for it? 
These are only a couple of examples of how this has continued from day XXXX. Another example is documentation on what I pay ion child support. I submitted requested documents on XXXX XXXX, and on the XXXX of XXXX, the bank tells me it 's not enough, and they are now asking for more information after more than a month has passed, and XXXX closing dated have come and gone. 
At this point I have no reason to believe that I will close on this even after 3 months have passed. 
I was pre-approved, have excellent credit, VA qualified, bank with Wells Fargo, permant employment, have a down payment and have been told multiple times throughout this process that we are real close, only to have the finish line moved out again and again."

Wells Fargo ordered a rush appraisal ( which they then charged me for although they told me we could not do a rush appraisal ), which the listing agent was able to convince the appraiser to come out on XXXX. Wells Fargo received the appraisal report around XXXX. We were able to get an extension to XXXX which surpassed the date Wells Fargo said we could close on XXXX. Now, Wells Fargo is saying we should be able to close on XXXX but I have no confidence that they will be able to close by this date. Their incompetence paired with their list of unrealistic demands in such a short amount of time is unfathomable. If they gave us all of the information needed up front then we would be able to close on time. Now, we are being held up because they decided last minute that we need to paint the house and that we need an inspection for the mold. If they gave us this information up front then we would have had sufficient time to close this loan. 

This has caused me unnecessary stress and our entire savings is on the line and Wells Fargo is acting extremely unprofessional. This has been escalated to higher management and they still can not communicate in an effective and professional manner."
50999,Credit reporting,"CRA 's are required to verify the information with the furnisher, by employing "" reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information '' ( XXXX v.

This account has been previously disputed through the CRA 's as unverified, inaccurate, and most likely fraudulent, yet mere "" verification '' of the information already in dispute was offered by Experian, failing to satisfy the federal courts ' definition of a reasonable and meaningful reinvestigation. I 've disputed with XXXX numerous times, but they pointed me to the purchaser of the alleged debt, who had been PAID IN FULL for this unverified debt when moved to get a judgement and I gave in. 

Please also note that XXXX reported ( see Experian reports dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), that the original amount of the debt was {$600.00}, yet also reported that it charged off {$1700.00}. XXXX then sold this fraudulent debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who collected over {$2000.00} from me to avoid a pending Judgement. Notably, the original amount of {$600.00} was subsequently removed from the Experian report, leaving only the charge off amount. 

To date, neither XXXX nor the purchaser of this alleged debt was able to verify that I incurred the debt, and both claim that they do not report or conduct any other collection activity on this account, why then is it on my Experian report?

During the call we, my husbands wheelchair had just stopped working while in the yard, and did not understand the terms of this offer, which sounded to him as though it was something to help us ( he was in the middle of trying to get his wheelchair to work ). Later we learned the interest rate not only increased substantially, but now was compounded daily, putting us much further in the rear. I called requesting assistance with the extreme added charges due to not understanding what the penalties were be, the offer was not explained in a matter that was understood. I was told to call back and that they would help, when I called back, I was denied any assistance. It took 7 years to pay off a 5 year loan. I will mail a completed report of the charges, I have requested from Ford. I believe that it was intended to defraud the consumer masked as assistance when needing it was needed the most.

CitiCard advised me they had contacted XXXX and XXXX had so many days to reply. XXXX replied by stating they never received "" their '' defective cement mixer back. I contacted XXXX and they told me they had proof that XXXX did receive the mixer back, as an employee of HF signed for the returned mixer. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received a letter from CitiCard which was dated XXXX XXXX, 2016. The letter stated what XXXX had stated regarding their mixer and advised me I have until XXXX XXXX, 2016 to prove to CitiCard that XXXX did in fact receive their mixer back.

I also told XXXX that I never ordered or was contacted regarding XXXX sending me another mixer. I contacted CitiCard and ultimately spoke to a supervisor in the "" Dispute Department '' of CitiCard. I explained to "" XXXX '' that the solution to this problem was easy. All that had to be done to resolve the issue was call XXXX and have XXXX fax the XXXX documents that XXXX XXXX signed upon receiving their XXXX cement mixers back.

XXXX explained the fax number she provided me was what amounts to a general receipt depository and nobody at CitiCard therefore takes XXXX personal responsibility if the fax should be lost, never received, missing in action etc. ( Unbelievable ) So, having little options I contacted XXXX and asked them to fax the proof that XXXX XXXX had in fact received both cement mixers back.

We have submitted documents numerous times and have received numerous letters stating that they had not received documents when we could prove via emails that the documents were sent. In this process my home has been in foreclosure and I hired counsel to help with that situation and the bank continued to move forward with the foreclosure and ignore the request for modification. Finally my attorney advised the Court that the bank was attempting to foreclose on the home at the same time the homeowner was requesting a modification. That the bank continued to ignore the modification. Finally after contacting the Florida Attorney General Office and working with them Carrington forwarded me a modification. 
At the time of the default I became XXXX overnight by a sever XXXX called XXXX and within the next year or so may be placed on a XXXX list. It has placed me on XXXX and has taken my income from over {$50000.00} a year to now only {$17000.00}. I have been an XXXX for almost my whole life. 
When I applied for the modification I explained to the bank that I was not able to pay the {$1400.00} payment per month and request a payment reduction. When I received the modification offer they sent me a payment of {$1400.00} per month. I was under the impression the modification was supposed to help homeowners not insult them. 
Second once I began to review the Carrington monthly statements I noticed that the statement had almost {$10000.00} of fees that were being added for "" mold treatment '' and field XXXX fees '' and numerous other things. My home is made of Cedar and would not require any mold treatment and no one has ever been to my home on XXXX XXXX, XXXX to treat my home for mold at the cost of {$5600.00}.

100131,Debt collection,"INITIAL CONTACT WITH DEBT COLLECTOR My name is XXXX XXXX. I started being harassed by Diversified Consultants Inc last year. I was told that I still owed on bill that I had with XXXX 3 years ago. I clearly remember paying that final bill with XXXX and terminating the phone because it no longer had service in the area where I lived. Now, three years later, in XXXX, I received a bill from Diversified Consultants , Inc., showing that I owed a debt of {$160.00} to XXXX. I requested Diversified Consultant to send me the final bill that was not paid to XXXX before I paid anything because I thought it was a scam. 

I PAID THE BALANCE In XXXX XXXX, Diversified Consultants sent me a copy of the billing statement from XXXX, showing that I had a remaining balance from XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX and they verified that I indeed had a debt with Diversified Consultants , Inc. and would need to pay Diversified Consultants, Inc., the {$160.00} balance. Since I did not have any documentation to prove that I did pay that balance in full in XXXX, I paid the debt to Diversified Consultants along with a {$10.00} fee on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, so I could remove this debt from my credit report. My confirmation number is XXXX. 

FOLLOW- UP # 1 AFTER PAYING THE BALANCE After a month, I checked my credit report and the debt was still showing as open. I called and spoke with Diversified Consultants, Inc. on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and advised that the balance was still showing a status of open on my credit report, even though I already paid it on XXXX.I was advised that it would be updated in 5- 30 business days. 

FOLLOW UP # 2 AFTER PLAYING THE BALANCE On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I decided to check my credit report again to see if the debt status had been updated to paid in full, especially since exactly six months had passed by. However, I noticed XXXX was still showing this debt in collections. So I called Diversified Consultants BACK AGAIN to let them know that the balance was not updated with XXXX. This time, a XXXX XXXX told me that he saw notes, proving that I initially paid the debt on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and also could see that I had called before seeking clarity of the balance being updated and reported to the bureau. He apologized and advised, that he will update the bureau and the status will be updated within 5-30 business days. To expedite the status update on my end, I also disputed the balance with XXXX. 

FOLLOW UP # 3 AFTER PAYING THE BALANCE Now, here it is XXXX XXXX, and I received an email from XXXX showing that Diversified Consultants is showing that my balance HAS NOT been paid. So this time, I called Diversified Consultant 's back to advise a supervisor, XXXX XXXX, of what was still showing on my credit report. He advised that it should have been updated to paid in full and was not sure why my credit report was showing that it was not paid in full. So I asked XXXX if he could email me a receipt to show that my balance was paid so I could send that receipt to XXXX and he told me that they could not do that. 

TAKING LEGAL ACTION After several disputes with XXXX, this account is still not showing that the XXXX debt with Diversified Consultants is still open. This is unacceptable and my credit is suffering because of it. Please let me know what I can do to escalate the removal of this debt on my credit report. I have carried this balance for 6 months even after it was paid. I 'm still not sure why it was there in the first place, but I paid it just to be sure nothing was on my credit, yet I am still suffering because of it. I am starting to feel like I was scammed and I am ready to take legal action, because I do n't have any proof in written documents showing that the balance was paid. 

PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT I CAN DO PRIOR TO SEEKING LEGAL COUNSEL.

Defendant receives another summons addressed to the XXXX address to appear in Court on XXXX XXXX, 2014 at the request of Plaintiff, without giving an option to Defendant 's circumstances. 

Plaintiff supplied numerous Discover Card Statements and a copy of the Contract prior to XXXX XXXX, 2014, to the Defendant and the Court for viewing as evidence. 
Defendant discovered that the documents had been altered to show the appearance that the Defendant had been receiving these statements in XXXX. 
Defendant has never received any Bank statement documents from Discover Bank at a XXXX address. 

Defendant has supplied the Court with factual evidence to proof his XXXX residency. To prove that the Plaintiff has filed in the wrong judicial jurisdiction, and case must be dismissed. 

Defendant on XXXX XXXX, 2014 notified the Court and the Plaintiff that the Defendant would not be able to appear on the XXXX XXXX date, due to his XXXX employment obligations. The filing returned address was my XXXX. 

Well the case was heard on XXXX XXXX, 2014, without the presence of the Defendant. The Plaintiff had prepared an Order Judgment document for the Judge to sign at the hearing, and through some persuasion his wishes were granted. Along knowing that he had won the case without having to argue against a Defendant objection. 

WHY WAS THIS CASE HEARD, without giving consideration to a Defendant rights to present some defense. When everyone knew the Defendant was not going to be present. 
What type of "" Dog and Pony '' show was this hearing? 

Defendant has submitted several requests to have this Case Vacated, based on the facts ; that ALL the evidence brought to this Court by the Plaintiff and client Discover Card Bank is false. 
This was just a clever, disrespectful and unlawful attempt to try and show that the Defendant resides in XXXX XXXXThe Defendant after receiving the shocking notice of Summary Judgment several months later as it was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and then forwarded to Defendants legal residency address in XXXX. 

Defendant filed a Dismissal request with the Court and the Plaintiff in XXXX 2014 with a return address receipt showing his XXXX address. 

IF the Defendant is to be held contractually obligated with the Discover Bank Card Contract and all its contents that the Plaintiff presented to the Court as evidence. If So ; then the whole contract has to be recognized, not just bits and pieces. 

The Plaintiff should be obligated to follow the Contract agreement under "" Arbitration and Hearings '' and propose a means of arbitration and possible mutual settlement. 

At no time during these proceedings has Arbitration been presented to the Defendant by the Plaintiff or its client Discover Bank. Violation of Discover Bank 's contract with Defendant.

I have spent numerous hours on the phone with Equifax, including filing both an online dispute and regular mail dispute - all with the outcomes that the tax liens on my credit report are valid.

Before this time, the Federal Loan servicing company consolidated my loans, rehabilitated my loans, and removed me from the offset list. However, before such time, I paid my student loans back in XXXX ways while I was in default. The first way that I paid back my loans was through an agreement with the XXXX XXXX XXXX who was a vendor/collector for the XXXX. I agreed for them to withdraw {$170.00} per month from my checking account for at least XXXX years. In addition, the offset list was intercepting my tax returns for about XXXX more years and applying those monies towards my defaulted student loan debts. The problem with that reality is the Federal Loan Servicing corporation have not credited my student loan account for what amounts to XXXX of thousands of dollars that I paid. I want for every payment to be credited to my student loan account, and for my payments to be reduced due to my current financial hardship. I need to be able to pay back my loans based upon my current income, as I want to remain in good standing but I also want to be given credit for the monies that I have already paid and what already was applied to my student loans through tax offsets."

They will be opening a brand new ( different ) Chase Freedom Visa Signature credit card account. I called on XXXX XXXX and then again on XXXX XXXX to speak with a supervisor, XXXX XXXX. In both conversations I got the same story. I could not just let the old card expire and request that a new account not be opened. I either had to wait for the new card and then call to cancel the new account or cancel the current account to stop the new XXXX from being opened. As part of the XXXX XXXX conversation, I opted for the latter option. Either way, I 've been put in a position of negatively affecting my credit score by having to voluntarily cancel an account. 

How is this fair? I thought part of the Act was to prevent credit card companies opening unasked for accounts - I guess their lawyers found a loophole for so-called "" existing '' customers? This stinks!"

Shortly after I received a call from the same woman ( before I knew my son had just spoken to her ) - She refused to say who she was or what my debt was- she demanded I give her my address and to prove my identity to her- I stated that was not going to happen- she became angry screaming at me so I hung up- my phone rang 3 more times from that number that night & every night since- there is always an auto generated voice mail saying to call wakefield & Associates XXXX for a debt in Colorado- I have never been to Colorado and do not have ANY past debt.

251183,Consumer Loan,Lending Club does not allow payments to be made early. You can make a payment early and reduce balance but does not count as the minimum payment due. All credit card companies allow you to make your minimum payment anytime up to and including the due date. For some odd reason Lending Club does not and offers no explanation other than to change the due date.
723750,Debt collection,"Last year, I began receiving fraudulent electricity bills at my address with my name and address from XXXX XXXX for a service address in a different city over XXXX hours away from where I live. I repeatedly called XXXX to try to resolve this problem but was brushed off and lied to. I spoke with customer service agents, fraud department, billing and collections and even the office of the CEO. I was told over and over again that there was nothing I could do because I was not listed as an authorized user of the account. They said I should not worry because they had another party listed as the account holder. They could not or would not look into or explain how my name had been linked to this account. I asked for my name and address to be removed from the account but was told I could not because I was not an authorized user of the account. I was assured that there would be no repercussions and that my name did not even show up on the main account information page. XXXX refused to investigate, refused to accept a dispute, refused to take a complaint over repeated calls for months. 
Finally, the account became delinquent and we began to receive notices from XXXX and then from a debt collection company. I immediately contacted the debt collection company, who were helpful. They told me that XXXX had sent them the account with only my name and address, despite the fact that XXXX had told me over and over that I was not responsible for the account and could not make any changes and that there was another person name listed as primary responsible party for the debt. In short, despite all of this, when the account became delinquent I was the XXXX held responsible for the debt. They also told me I needed to and was entitled to file a dispute with XXXX. I called XXXX to confront them with this information and threaten legal action through a complaint to the PUB. In response, XXXX now, finally, claims to be taking action to clear my name, remove my address from the account and send a cease collection notice to the debt collection company. I have yet to see proof of this, and they do not intend to send me any proof. I fear that this negligence and incompetence on their part will end with me having to pay a debt that is not mine in order to clear the record of this bogus debt now associated with my name and address. And even if they have taken action to correct this fiasco, I can not forgive the months of incompetence that preceded it. 
I want to reiterate that at this time, GC Services collection company is NOT in any way responsible for this, as they explained to me that XXXX sent the wrong information to them. I hope this will continue to be the case."
304233,Mortgage,"Over the past 10 years of home ownership my wife and I have had a mortgage with at least XXXX different lenders due to our mortgage being sold or refinanced. We have stayed in the same home in that time frame but have continually paid more than the minimum payment required with the goal in mind to pay more principle off our mortgage putting ourselves in a better financial position for future financial goals. Starting in XX/XX/2016, our current mortgage company, applied the overage of the payment we made as a credit to the following month 's payment of interest and escrow instead of applying the overage of the payment to principal for the XX/XX/2016 payment. As a result, our statement showed our payment itemization as 2 principle payments, 2 escrow payments, and 2 interest payments on the single statement in XX/XX/2016. This was very confusing at first because the second interest and escrow payments were not identified separately to show they were payments for the following month. I only discovered that upon calling to inquire about the statement. I realized at that point how important my record of payments was because there was nothing else to prove that I paid extra other than my record. ( the mortgage statement and my banking statement ) I informed the mortgage representative that I always want my overpayment to apply to the principle. The representative informed me that this was not an error on their part but simply a systematic software issue whenever there is a complete double payment on the mortgage. The representative then assured me that the issue was resolved and would not happen again. I was satisfied with the end of the conversation at that point. However, the same issue occurred again in XX/XX/XXXX of last year and 2 additional times after XX/XX/XXXX for a total of 4 times in 13 months. After speaking with at least 9 different representatives of the mortgage company including 2 different supervisors over 13 months, I have concluded that the mortgage company is incapable or unwilling to satisfy my needs as a customer. It seems to me that it should be basic good business practices for a mortgage company to apply all of any current months ' payment to the current month as it is paid in the current month to avoid any conflict. In other words, in my case payment should always apply to that months interest and escrow with all additional payment applying to principle. Applying any payment to any other month should only be done as agreed upon by both parties. My wife and I have never made such an agreement."
669176,Debt collection,"I am attempting to obtain a mortgage loan, and noted in my credit report an item from IQ Data International ( IQDI ), a debt collection agency in XXXX, WA. Because I was unfamiliar with this item, I contacted IQDI, and was informed that the account listed on my credit report ( XXXX ) was not my account, and instead belongs to a XXXX XXXX ( a name which is very similar to my own ). Because time is of the essence, I requested that IQ Data International provide the credit bureau documentation stating that I do not owe this debt, so that the item could be cleared from my credit report. I was told that they were unwilling to provide such documentation because the mistake was made by the credit bureau, and not IQDI. In addition, the person that I spoke with was EXTREMELY discourteous - bordering on nasty. When I then contacted XXXX, I was informed that the mistake was in fact made by IQDI, and that my only recourse was to dispute the items and wait for IQDI to respond, which could take up to 30 days. I was hesitant to file a dispute, as my lender informed me that this was viewed negatively, and further, waiting 30 days could delay closing on a mortgage and jeopardize my ability to complete the purchase of a home. IQDI should be accountable for fixing mistakes, particularly when they admit that their own internal records show that they reported incorrect information to the credit bureau, and they should be accountable for providing documentation of a reporting error when such documentation is requested by a consumer."

473451,Mortgage,"In XXXX of 2014 my real estate agent ( XXXX ) submitted a contract on my behalf for a short sale home owned by Chase Banking. After 6 months of continuous waiting and no status updates ( approx. XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) Chase finally acknowledged the contract and countered the original offer - we agreed. Finally, ( we thought XXXX things were on its way to being finalized. From there, the inspection was done- serious issues were addressed and being handled. That, in itself, took a little more time than we cognized and was eventually rectified. Next, the appraisal was done- it came back fine- with minor improvements to be done. After roughly 1 1/2 months of negotiating, my bank could now get my financing finalized ( I was preapproved for a {$7500.00} downpayment and closing cost grant ). I was also receiving an FHA loan and my paperwork could not be fully processed until all the repairs were improvised and/or rectified. While waiting to hear back from the grant approval team, we received an email from the seller 's agent ( approx. XXXX XXXX ) stating "" Chase has officially denied the contract '' with no warning, extension or any explanation. My banker, the seller 's agent and my real estate agent were completely and utterly in shock by this unforseen action. The seller 's agent along with my banker sent a slew of emails with evidenced data regarding my full approval -but we never heard anything from them. This was a spontaneous act that hindered, interferred and just simply hurt my families progress and well- being, with no "" JUSTIFICATION ''. I have XXXX young children and I had already put in my 30 day notice to move out of my townhome. I had an inspection ( {$380.00} ) and appraisal ( {$470.00} ) done on the property prior to this happening. I was genuinely interested in the home and did everything that was in my power to get things done in a timely manner. However, they had my team waiting for 6 months before they even touched my contract but they could n't wait a few weeks for my official process to be completed. If anything, they could have explained their rational behind their actions. I could not have just exited the contract without reasoning in the middle of it. The bottom line is ; I felt like I was bullied and mistreated unfairly because I was purchasing a home that was priced below market value and I was an assumed indigent. I 've called and spoken to XXXX XXXX at Chase Executive office. After playing phone tag for several days, she ambiguously explained to me that ; she could not give me any information regarding the account because I was not the primary account holder- which I understood. Which, she knew that I did not have an account with them, I explained that to her in my at length email that she received. The bottom line is ; the whole entire ordeal was bias and unethical and I felt discriminated against."

I have never contacted or been involved or have gave any authorization to them with my information to run my credit or open accounts with these companies. Equifax agent told me to call these companies and tell them to get me removed from my credit report. I called each one of these companies and they all said I have no open accounts with them and they have n't ran my credit or anything with my social security number or name so there is no way they can remove inquiries when there is no open accounts under my information. These companies told me to contact equifax again and let them know that they have never ran my credit or have any accounts open. So I did called equifax and they told me that it does show that these companies ran my credit. At this point i do n't know what to do.

When I saw the inQuiries from these companies I was shocked because I 've never had anything to do with them. I thought I was a victim of identity theft or maybe I am. I 'm thinking maybe someone is using my identity, using my information, opening accounts with my information. Messing up my credit. But where can I find out? Who do I go to or call?

So, for me she said I need to consolidate some loans, then wait and considate others by paper, etc. I told her I have not idea what to do and I get different responses from everyone I talk to and she said do you read the emails we send and I told her I try to, but I wo n't get anything for weeks, then I will get like 10 emails in one day and they all say something different so I am at a lost.

They also told me that both that the policy had and had n't been cancelled yet. They refused to tell me that they would actually pay the bill for the insurance. They refused to do anything to help ensure that I would continue to have insurance, aside from call my insurance agent. When I asked for something in writing to demonstrate how they would prevent this from occurring again she refused.

I called Macy 's and asked for some sort of resolution and was advised the only option was to close the account, not other hardship arrangement could be made. I then emailed XXXX explain my situation and requested a one time courtesy to have the negative credit reporting removed. I then received a phone call from XXXX, I emailed her after numerous times trying to reach her by telphone but to no avail. Then, I received an email from XXXX stating they would not do anything differently than what has already been done and to contact her if I had any other concerns so I did. I have been trying to pay my recent "" Special Event '' financing purchase off as well as catch up the past due balance and I can not get anyone on the phone that speaks reasonably clear XXXX. The individuals I am able to reach simply transfers the call as "" protocol '' without offering any assistance for something as simple as making a payment. I have several questions that have gone unanswered and everyone seems to provide a generic email response, or I am speaking with "" customer service/collections specialists '' that are telling me conflicting information. I was told yesterday that I needed to just make the payment totalling the past due amount plus the balance of the special event purchase then call back in 24-48 hours and tell them how to apply the funds. She also stated my monthly balance continues to increase because of the one missed payment, but they are not late fees. Late fees are added to the entire amount owed. How then is my balance {$280.00} now instead of the {$180.00} I was paying prior to missing XXXX payment? I emailed XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX in the executive office explaining my issue of communication with reps within their company and no one has contacted me to resolve the issue. Today I spoke with someone by the name ( s ) of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. XXXX advised me that if I pay the special event purchase off then that will take care of the past due balance also. My specific question was "" How will that take care of a past due balance that is treated separately from this purchase? '' He could not answer me then claimed my phone was breaking up, yet I had no issue speaking and explaining the situation to two reps prior to being transferred to him.

Repeated attempts by me to work directly with BofA, in its various incarnations, via mail and phone have been fruitless. If I do receive response from them, it is only in the form of a standard letter saying the matter is being researched, but this has been the case for years now with no resolution. 

In compiling information for this Complaint, I am noticing Servicing Rights were sold to Bank of America on XXXX/XXXX/06 under a/c # XXXX.

I am currently waiting on Pennymac to send me an email, stating what documents are missing.

12165,Debt collection,"This is a complaint from XXXX ( consumer ) against XXXX ( creditor ). XXXX Bank has unfairly and deceptively misrepresented its mailing address, making it difficult for consumers to contact it and resolve disputed debts. 

As of XX/XX/2017, XXXX is reporting an open collection account on Consumer 's XXXX credit report [ see exhibit A ]. Consumer does not recognize this debt, so on XX/XX/2017, consumer ( through legal counsel ) sent a written request for documentation to the contact address provided by XXXX in the credit report which requested documentation regarding the original debt [ see exhibit B ]. 
On XX/XX/2017, the letter was returned to sender and marked as "" Not Deliverable as Addressed. '' [ See Exhibit C ] This letter was sent to the address listed as the creditor 's contact information on page 38 of consumer 's credit report. Despite a records and internet search no other mailing address, phone number, fax number or email address could be found. Without a valid mailing address, XXXX can not obtain information regarding the debt and therefore can not make an informed decision about it. 

XXXX is a sophisticated party in the consumer debt industry and is aware of the need to be available for consumer inquiries. Knowing this, XXXX has made it virtually impossible for a consumer to initiate communication with it. I can only surmise that XXXX 's isolation and obscurity is intentional and for the purpose of unfairly frustrating, deceiving and abusing consumers."

524390,Mortgage,"My mortgage was paid through the sale of my home. The balance paid resulted in an over payment. BBVA Compass indicated that they were to issue a refund to me, for {$1200.00} processed on the XXXX. I contacted them on the XXXX of XXXX to inquire where my refund was. I was told that the check was mailed on the XXXX of XXXX, and that I needed to fill out an affidavit of indemnity for them to reissue payment, and that they would directly deposit the funds afterward. I did so, and then followed up with them, at which point I was told that they had mailed the check a second time rather then placing it in my account. They indicated they would stop the second check and then deposit funds, and that I should hear back on the XXXX confirming the same. I did not hear from them, but did receive the first check on the XXXX, which they failed to mail until the XXXX despite their representation. It is absolutely unacceptable that they could not simply tell me that they had only mailed the check two days prior from Alabama. I would of course been upset that it took them that long, but this whole ordeal and comedy of errors could have been avoided. I called back again on the XXXX, and was told by a supervisor that my funds would be in my account Friday after business hours, the XXXX. On top of that, they mailed my 2nd check to the wrong address. I did not receive my funds as promised. I called them again today, and they of course ca n't get a supervisor on the line. I was told they would have a supervisor call me, and I have not received a call. I have tried dealing with them and I am fed up. If I owed this bank a delinquent payment I would be assessed fines and collection calls. This is ridiculous that they ca n't competently process a refund, and continue to make false promises."
774376,Money transfers,"I have a complaint against Western Union. I had made several transactions to XXXX before someone from Western decided to let me know that that area had been deemed a known area for scams. On XXXX XXXX I had made several transactions to XXXX XXXX XXXX for the purchase of a puppy I thought I had bought from a XXXX XXXX XXXX from Virginia. The transactions I had made this day totaled {$1400.00}. It was n't until Monday XXXX XXXX when I went to make another transaction that a Western Union employee stopped the transaction and took some information from me and told me that this was a flagged area for scams. At that time I was reimbursed my money in the sum of {$2200.00}. I was the stupid one after that and the individual convinced myself and my mother that the puppy was coming and that they needed the money. So we decided to send the last {$2200.00} anyway. 
I did file a police report because I would like to at least recoup the money I sent prior to being warned about the scam area. 
I want to share this with the world because this is a scam that pertains to the selling and shipping of puppies. Looking on the internet under what I thought were legitimate sites ( XXXX. ) I thought I was purchasing a XXXX puppy from a man in VA, by the name of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) for {$450.00}. He sent me paperwork for change in ownership and everything. He said that he was going to ship the dog and that I should receive him in a day or so and that the shipping company would be contacting me. I did n't think about it at the time but he insisted that I send the money through XXXX. The money went to VA so I thought everything was good. 
Well the shipping company ( under the logo of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX ) contacted me the next day to tell me that they needed {$1200.00} to provide a crate for the puppy and insurance, which would all be refunded once the puppy arrived. I in turned called the seller back and asked him if this was legit and he assured me it was, me not thinking he was in on the entire scam, I sent the money using my Debit card through XXXX and sent it Western Union. I did find it odd at the time that I was sending it to XXXX, but I figured since it was an international company that may be normal. 
Well the next day the shipping company kept calling and for some reason the puppy could never get on the flight coming to FL. Then Sunday they called stating that they needed another {$2200.00} for the USDA certificate and license so that the puppy could come to the state of FL and that the puppy had to go through customs. I kept telling him the puppy only came from VA why was he going through customs. He being of XXXX nationality kept saying it was part of their process. I reluctantly paid the {$2200.00} because the dog was for my mom who really wanted a XXXX and I really wanted her to have XXXX. She has XXXX XXXX and she 's on XXXX so she does n't get to leave the house very often and she wanted a companion and I thought this would make her happy and I wanted to give it to her for XXXX. It was this day reality slapped me hard in the face. Western Union had flagged XXXX and they told me that this was a scam. I was so convinced that these individuals were being honest with me that I did not listen even after Western Union gave me the {$2200.00} back. I still sent it, {$1100.00}, {$1100.00}, because I just did n't want to see the truth. But like I said reality slapped me hard in the face. 
All I want is the {$1400.00} back from Western Union because if they knew it was a area known for scams, they should not allow anyone to transfer to that area."

237134,Mortgage,"I have recently received a notice from HSBC Bank USA , NA, dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 that the servicing of my mortgage is transferred effective XXXX XXXX, 2016 to another mortgage services company ( XXXX ). The notice further states that no payments will be accepted after XXXX XXXX, 2016. My mortgage payment is currently auto deducted from my account with HSBC Bank USA , NA and this has been stopped. 

However, I also received a monthly mortgage statement from HSBC Bank USA indicating that my mortgage payment is due effective XXXX XXXX, 2016 and that the payment should be mailed to HSBC at a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

My concerns are : 1 - The fact that HSBC has given only 15 days notice of the transfer of servicing, which is not sufficient time for consumers to be aware and make alternate payment arrangements. 
2 - The fact that they have discontinued my automatic deduction ( which ordinarily is deducted around the XXXX of the month ) with less than 60 days notice for me to make alternate arrangements. 
3 - The fact that HSBC has continued to bill me for a mortgage payment, which they have notified me that they have transferred, which they should no longer be able to do. 

Simply stated if the bank is unable to make the necessary arrangements in 15 days and continues to bill consumers, then why are consumers expected to make alternate arrangements in the same period of time."
52477,Student loan,"Hello. I have a formal complaint to lodge against Navient and am trying to go through the proper channels to do it. 
Here is what occurred : I wanted to send in a bulk payment of {$2000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX since some unexpected money had come in ( my aunt had passed away, and a small bank account was located with a couple thousand dollars ). 
I called Navient BEFORE I sent in the XXXX to get their assurance that the money would be applied toward my monthly payments ( which were {$110.00} at that time ) and not toward the principal. We discussed the time that payments would resume in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX. 
I received their guarantee that this money would be applied to these monthly payments which would have meant that another payment at that XXXX rate would not be due for a year and four months ( so around XX/XX/XXXX ). 
I sent in the payment of {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I was asked to fill out the income-based paperwork in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX, and I submitted it. I made less that year than the previous year. 
I received notification from Navient that I would need to start making payments of {$55.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called Navient in XXXX and an hour and a half into the inquiry, the supervisor agreed with me that no payment was due until XX/XX/XXXX, in fact if the payments were calculated starting in XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, the payment already sent in should be applied even past XX/XX/XXXX. The supervisor who confirmed that what I was saying was accurate stated that he would send a confirmation of the adjustment within ten days. 
The adjustment confirmation did not arrive. 
I called back and was given some story about the previous year 's payment schedule having ended after 10 months instead of the full year ( no explanation given concerning why that would have been true, especially since I always turn everything in on time and properly completed & no payment schedule before this one had been ended early ) and that my payments had reverted back to the originally threatened $ 300+ that would 've been the amount due if I had not applied for income-based consideration. 
Since they cited this 300+ amount as what was taken out as payment from the {$2000.00}, they had come up with monthly payments of {$55.00} being due starting in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have not had time to say anything about this due to my mother 's sudden illness and consequent move from the house where she 'd lived for 28 years. That plus my job have kept me over-occupied until now. 
The bottom line here is that Navient lied to me at all points along the way and stole portions of my money that they were not entitled to. 
I 've been making the XXXX payments since XX/XX/XXXX since I have no recourse. 
I contacted the Navient advocacy group, and it turns out that the income-based program that I was in when I called them in XX/XX/XXXX has particular perameters that would have precluded the payments being applied past a year. They readily agreed that I was given misinformation but that they did not have the power to go back and adjust anything ; all they were willing to do was to pass on the complaint. 
It is my contention that Navient still is responsible for what I was told. They dispensed the misinformation upon which I based my decision about where best to distribute the money. I was trying to be responsible and have the payments covered almost up to when I retire in XX/XX/XXXX. I would have put the money toward paying off my credit card or toward the principal on my mortgage otherwise. They can not give people misinformation that people act on in good faith without being accountable. They ca n't tell people the wrong thing that results in loss of money on the consumer end and then just say sorry, sorry. 

Sincerely, XXXX"
615052,Bank account or service,"Two issues XXXX 1. PNC Bank has a policy where if a customer has his or her credit card attached to a checking account, and the checking account is over drawn then PNC will transfer the minimum of {$50.00} dollars to the over drawn account. However, PNC only allows a payment to be made up to XXXX, which means in almost all cases, a payroll deposit that comes through at midnight, will almost always be too late to cover the amount over drawn, thereby allowing PNC Bank to charge a minimum {$10.00} or a percentage ( which ever is greater ) over draft or transfer fee. 
2. PNC Bank notifies the account holder after the over over draft or transfer fee has occurred, which does not allow a payment to be made prior to the fee being charged. 

I believe PNC Bank deliberately set the time to pay an over drawn account at XXXX, to prevent account holders with payroll deposits from being able to place the over drawn funds back into their account before the fee is charged. I also believe PNC Bank deliberately notifies their customers after the fact to ensure that they can charge the overdraft fee. 

I did speak with PNC Bank regarding this matter and they response is that I should keep a positive bank account."
670238,Mortgage,"Quicken Loans mailed me a notice that claimed I was prequalified to refinance my home mortgage. ( My mortgage is currently with another lender. ) The notice claimed "" You 're already prequalified to refinance your home loan at a low, 30-year fixed interest rate of 4.125 % ( 4.273 % APR ). This lower rate could reduce your monthly mortgage payment to {$1500.00}! '' The claim clearly indicates that my current mortgage rate is higher than their rate and that my monthly payments would go down with this refinance. They even mention my current approximate mortgage balance in the advertisement which gave me the impression that they have my current loan information from my recorded mortgage or credit report. However, my current mortgage rate is much lower ( 3.25 % fixed for 30 years originated in XXXX 2012 ) and later in the fine print they also planned to charge me 1.75 % in points to get their higher interest rate. The P & I payment they quote of {$1500.00} is slightly lower that my current P & I payment of {$1500.00} but they are re-amortizing my current balance over a new 30 year period to achieve that $ XXXXmonth savings! This refinance would cost me considerably more interest over the term of the loan despite the lower payment. Clearly, their claims are not in my best interest and are deceptive ; particularly, their claim that they will lower my interest rate."

317688,Credit card,"I signed up for an American Express Platinum credit card with a XXXX signup bonus and a {$3000.00} minimum spending requirement. I was using the card for my regular purchases, not tracking exactly how much I was spending. About a month later, I received XXXX points in my account. As a regular consumer, I assumed that I had spent enough for the signup bonus because I received it in my account. I kept on using the card for my purchases and thought nothing of it and the 3 month deadline for the minimum spend came and past. About 4 months after I signed up for the card, I suddenly found out that XXXX points were taken from me. I tried contacting American Express, and they said that apparently I did properly fulfill the terms and conditions of the signup offer, but the customer service representative did not know exactly why I was not eligible. I am contacting the CFPB because American Express is running a bait and switch scheme by promising a lucrative signup bonus, misleading me into thinking I have fulfilled the requirements of the offer, and then pulling the offer when I have no recourse by using a technicality in the terms and conditions. If I did not fulfill the terms and conditions, there is no need to wait 3 months to remove the points on my account with zero communication prior to this. If there was any type of communication, I could have fixed the issue. What is especially malicious is that they removed my signup bonus the day after an implementation of a no refund policy for the annual fee. Thus, they took my {$450.00} annual fee when I was under the impression that I received my signup bonus, and once I was not eligible for a refund on the fee, they took my signup bonus back. This is certainly deceptive advertising and American Express should not be allowed to continue this shady behavior."

Based on this, the next five years, assuming a 1 % Libor each year, would cause the rate to be 7.24 %, a full 322 % gain, or at a minimum, an additional cost to me of {$5200.00}. This is usury. 

The loan agreement does stipulate this Libor rate increase but it is XXXX '' thick document, over XXXX pages, and I missed the full Libor increase clause when initiated. I thought, when they said an increase it meant the percentage change in the rate, not the full Libor rate. A change would mean subtracting today 's Libor rate from the original rate and using the sum as the adder. This would be reasonable. 

Credit score is not in question because mine is XXXX. Is there anything you can do to relieve me of this additional cost?"

657393,Mortgage,"I was in active review for a loan modification since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( see attached, email receipt from M & T Bank acknowledging a packet has been received ). I had complied with all of the document requests ( see email chain between my counselor XXXX XXXX and M & T Bank, XXXX XXXX was sending the documents through the portal on my behalf ). As you can see, M & T failed many times to respond to XXXX requests for updates on my loan, and when she tried physically calling to M & T bank since she was n't getting written responses, M & T Bank told her they did not have authorization on file, when it was faxed to them once on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and again it was sent with the packet submitted through Hope Loan Portal on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. There were so many delays on M & T Bank 's part that XXXX XXXX had to get a 3rd party involved to try to force M & T Bank to respond ( those emails are also attached ). 
XXXX XXXX had to refax the authorization form twice in XXXX XXXX after trying, but failing to get an update on my file. She refaxed the authorization form to M & T on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and they said they did n't get it, which caused another delay. She then tried emailing again though Hope Loan Portal to no avail ; then refaxed it on XXXX in desperation. M & T finally received that one ( I have an acknowledgement letter attached ) and then told XXXX XXXX the house had already sold at foreclosure auction on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
My house sold because I did not have a copy of my pension award letter ( you can see that was the last thing they wanted ) - I could not get it that fast because the award letter had to be mailed, my pension benefits department would not fax it to me. M & T did nothing to help stall my foreclosure sale date even though they were only waiting for ONE document, and they had plenty of time to try to stall the foreclosure to help me get my documents to them. They also caused numerous delays, as you can see, by not responding to update requests in any sort of timely manner. My house would not be sold if they were doing their job in helping me delaying the foreclosure by a few days to allow me to get a copy of my award letter. I complied with all of their requests and unfortunaltely I could n't make my pension benefits department "" hurry up ''. Even though they did n't have the actual award letter, I did send them the pension statements I get in the mail each month and the amount clearly does not change ; also my bank statements I sent to them every month show the same pension deposits every month - unchanging. Despite all of this, M & T kept moving forward with foreclosure because I did n't have the ACTUAL award letter even though they see it stays the same every month."

771134,Credit card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to close my Capital One credit card due to issues with customer service. Capital One refused to do so, however. As of this writing, it appears that Capital One has still refused to do so. The first attempt was via telephone, starting at XXXX XXXX. The initial representative refused to close the account ( on which there was a zero balance ), as did the supervisor. Further, the supervisor refused to provide a NY address to which complaints and a written instruction to close the account could be sent. 

The second call, starting at XXXX XXXX was largely similar. I then tried to close the account via the website. Despite allowing virtually every other type of transaction, the website does not apparently permit the closing of an account requiring that to be accomplished via telephone. I can only assume this is part of an intentional strategy to frustrate customers who wish to leave Capital One. The third call was substantially similar to the first two, except that Capital One cut off the call when I asked to speak to a supervisor. 

The representative on the fourth call, after a few minutes, said that she would close the account, then told me it was accomplished, and promised an email confirming the closure. Thereafter, however, she transferred me to another person, who said the account was still open. This after more than an hour trying to close the account."

477337,Debt collection,"In XXXX I went through a divorce therefore substantially lowering my income and was unable to pay on a credit card with Capital One.

I then requested in writing from Capital One an accurate statement including the agreed upon settlement amount and all payments received on the account. Capital One responded that they did not have record of an account with them. I resent my original request along with their original account statement and letter referencing no account on file. No further response from Capital One regarding my request. In XXXX of XXXX I received a threatening phone call from a man named XXXX XXXX who continue to cuss and threaten legal proceedings if I did not pay the Capital One debt.

I also explained that the name and address on the XXXX is also incorrect. The representative informed me that they will NOT correct it and according to their records it is accurate.

615082,Mortgage,"As we attempted to financially recover from lengthy stints of unemployment, due to the XXXX recession, it was in XXXX of XXXX that our cash reserves ultimately expired. Neither my wife nor I were able to obtain employment at that time. And access to any unemployment benefits had lapsed. The bank 's actions ( or lack of ) to obtain a loan modification or seek financial assistance has only made our financial situation worse -- and more stressful on the family. 

We have literally spent hundreds of hours of filling out forms, collecting statements and faxing XXXX-plus pages of documentation to them at a time. It felt at times as if the bank was attempting to coerce us to short-sell and play on one 's own fears during times of great stress. Phone conversations with bank staff show a pattern of negative suggestive type statements rather pursuing a constructive plan of action and possibilities. Questions by bank staff were asked in a manner as to not divulge options readily. For example, questions about our intent to sell the house or confidence in finding work, were carefully asked before any mention of the loan modification program was made. 

Our inability to move forwarded after 2-years with a loan modification, even after several petitions, raises into question the bank 's intent of genuinely completing a loan modification -- even though it 's associated with a Federal HAMP program. Even after showing a full rebound in income in XXXX and obtaining a full-time professional position in XXXX with a large multi-national company, the bank 's actions have not changed. 

The bank 's actions have only changed upon contacting our state 's Attorney General and one our Senator 's for assistant. This included having the bank stop the robo-phone collection calls, calling from unrecognized phone numbers, claiming to lost or not have received the paperwork, not willing to correspond via email as the process evolved and more. Or, when the town considered placing a lien on the property for real estate taxes has the bank ever disbursed funds of any kind. If the town placed a lien of the property it takes precedence over the bank 's debt claims We have provided the bank with an extensive amount of personal information through the submission of bank statements in full. It is possible, for example, to assess our family 's medical care activity by scrubbing these bank statements. In return, the bank has provided no information in regards to a proposal of any kind or even articulating the financial concerns they may have. 

Instead, the bank has returned our checks when attempting to make a payment. The claim being they will not accept payment unless it is of the amount specified. Which is impractical upon initially regaining employment and beginning to financially recover. At this time our mortgage payments are not accepted and the loan modification process is beginning again -- for the sixth-plus time. This unfortunately goes against our credit and falsely creates the appearance that we are not making attempts to rectify the situation. 

We consider these loan modification actions to be nothing short of predatory, fraudulent and negligent given the process is tied to a federal program. Especially in light of the fact that the banking industry itself was bailed out by the federal government at a never before seen level of support. As a family, however, from the bank 's perspective, we are not to be afforded a similar opportunity to financially recover. 

Nevertheless, we remain optimistic that a loan modification will obtained. Our primary request is that the process be fair and equitable and that by filing this complaint it will bring a sense balance to the situation."

A ticket was opened. A gentleman from the IT department called in XX/XX/XXXX and said that he could see a lot of streaming at odd hours. I told him that I did some streaming but it should not be {$700.00} worth of streaming. 

I immediately disconnected, removed the battery from the wireless device and put it in a drawer. I called again to find out what information the ticket produced. I spoke with an IT manager XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. She told me I was still incurring charges. I told her that could not be because I took the device apart. I was prepared to pay what I owed but not if the device was malfunctioning and still continuing to incur charges when it should not. To ensure I would no longer incur more charges I asked XXXX to close my account. She said she would dispute the charges, but could not do it until the billing cycle completed. Both bills were disputed and I have been waiting to hear the results. 

I have called several times during the waiting period in XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with another woman who told me a Diamond ticket had to be opened. She told me she initiated the Diamond Ticket. 

I received a call that my bill was going into collections. I called Customer Service again in XX/XX/XXXX to let them know I was waiting to hear back on the results of my ticket ( dispute ). The customer support person told me he would notify the collections department to wait until the ticket was resolved. 

I received notification a week ago that my credit report was updated in XX/XX/XXXX. I saw the XXXX bill listed. It should not have been listed because I never received a resolution to the investigation. There should be a credit due back to my account because I know there were issues with the device. 

It would appear that the collections department and the Customer Service Department are not communicating. In fact, the woman I spoke with last week at the Collections Department said she did not see that a Diamond ticket or any ticket had ever been opened.

We have been waiting for weeks upon weeks to get a BPO/Appraisal to come to client 's property. Every week they order an BPO/Appraisal and nothing comes of it. No phone calls, no scheduling. Nothing. Ocwen continues to state every that someone is coming will contact me. They have already scheduled a foreclosure date of XXXX XXXX, 2015. We have a buyer and the buyer is now growing impatient with the waiting process. Ocwen told my me that they will not allow an escalation. They will not reveal the investor on the loan. They only state that we will have to continue to wait for BPO/Appraiser to come out. We have been waiting for over 4 weeks ago. They are setting this client up for a strategic foreclosure. They continue to tell me that they do not know why no one has contacted me but wait another 7-10 days and "" maybe '' someone will call. Ocwen is really being unprofessional about this. This is a HAFA short sale and for them not to give me any information on who else to contact is ridiculous. I need help with Ocwen. This is stressing my client out. She does not want a foreclosure on her record, but Ocwen is forcing XXXX her."

His contact information is GMAC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. From the documentation I kept in my files, this is what I have pieced together. My husband and I were quoted a fixed rate of 8.25 % XXXX mo term. We received the loan documents to review on XXXX/XXXX/06. Everything looked good per the TIL and Good Faith. We then received a second copy which I kept. Then we received a third copy which turns out, was not the same set of documents. It is dated one day later on XXXX/XXXX/06 and did not include any specifics about the loan, no TIL and no Good Faith were included. I also have a copy of the closing instructions dated XXXX/XXXX/06. with no TIL or GF listed in the document section of the closing instructions. My loan was since sold to OCWEN. I recently received a letter from the current HELOC financer stating that I will be making the final loan payments at full principal as per the terms of my interest only loan. The problem is that my husband and I never applied for an interest only HeLOC. We feel that we closed on a different loan than what was initially disclosed to us and defrauded of 10 years of principal payments."
586549,Student loan,"I previously sent a dispute letter to the credit bureaus regarding the late payments on my account with Great Lakes. They were verified in which I agreed with and they annotated my credit report as being in dispute. I then sent them a letter by fax on XXXX XXXX which after me calling they received, that I was no longer disputing the account and to remove the dispute. The lady over the phone assured me that the dispute comment would be removed from my credit report. I am currently working with a mortgage broker to get approved for a home and this keeps holding me back from getting approved. Is n't this a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act if they fail to remove the dispute comment after I specifically told them it was no longer in dispute? 

I also looked at my credit report and noticed that the updated my account as being XXXX past due as of XXXX XXXX when this account was closed on XXXX XXXX. This dropped my credit score about XXXX points because it shows I was recently late which is not true. How can they get away with this?"

340506,Bank account or service,"I filed a CFPB complaint against TD Bank on XXXX XXXX, 2015 -- Case number XXXX. TD Bank 's reply was not at all satisfactory. Aside from the reply 's failure to address the issues I raised in my complaint, it claimed that TD deposited {$30.00} to my account as compensation. However, I never received any such deposit -- in any of my TD accounts. Therefore, I filed a dispute on XXXX. I still have never received the said {$30.00} deposit, nor any communication directly from TD. I believe that their actions, as described in my original XXXX XXXX complaint and XXXX XXXX dispute, constitute unfair and deceptive practices. Given the absolute black and white nature of whether or not they made the said compensatory deposit to my account, in addition to the many other issues regarding crediting my savings account with the wrong interest rate multiple times, I believe that it is appropriate for me to file this new complaint, as was suggested to me by a CFPB phone representative. As detailed in my original complaint and dispute, I fear that countless other TD customers are being paid far less interest than what they are entitled to, and that they are not aware of the situation and/or do not have the ability to deal with the problem. Also, I am amazed that TD stated to your Bureau that they made a deposit to my account which, now, weeks later, still has not been made. 

Please note that I just moved to XXXX FL from XXXX MA a few days ago. My original address was XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX, XXXX, MA XXXX ; my original phone was XXXX."

When I called them yesterday regarding the {$910.00} and change balance in my escrow account I was informed that it was their policy to hold that money for 20 days in case there was any financial claim against the property for outstanding tax. I pointed out that the sale went through a title company who would not have issued title insurance if there were any outstanding claims against the property. I then suggested that if they were going to hold my money that maybe they should pay me interest on it, of course that was not an option, even though I pointed out that if I had {$910.00} of Bank of America 's money for 20 seconds let alone 20 days they would expect interest. They may have some legal loophole that allows them to do this but just because you can do something does n't mean you should. They are holding my money for no good reason other than they have found another way of ripping off the consumer."

Unfortunately, the mortgage company has spun me into a bureaucratic circle repeatedly and the issue still is n't resolved. The mortgage companies failure to resolve the issue in a timely manner led to another series of events and issues with the main issue being that Escrow was added, home owners insurance was added and taxes were added.

573009,Consumer Loan,"On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, at XXXX I called TitleMax at XXXX. I spoke with a man whom I believe to be XXXX XXXX XXXX, about getting a installment loan on my XXXX XXXX, and pay off the balance of my interest only loan I had with TitleMax, on my XXXX XXXX, that I had taken out when my mother had past away to help pay for her funeral. I had an option when I did the loan at the TitleMax store located on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ga., to do an interest only month to month loan, or the option to pay over time with installments payments. I believe I was shown 2 options ( papers ), with scheduled payment amounts, how much each payment would be each month, how much would go towards interest, and how much would be applied to paying down the principle balance. The other option was just to pay interest only, month to month, and I understood and agreed to do the interest only loan. The lady that did my loan explained everything to me.I read the paperwork, signed the documents, and regretted not doing the installment loan because I have not been reimbursed from the estate within a month or so after taking out the interest only loan. I had thought I would have paid that off within a few months at the most when I took that loan out. I explained to XXXX XXXX when I called him on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, that I DID NOT WANT THE SAME TYPE LOAN AS I HAD ON MY XXXX. I was on my way to work when I called. He explained to me over the phone, after giving me directions to his location, because the Titlemax location I had used for the XXXX loan had closed or moved, and I had been making payments over the phone to this location every month, located on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Ga. XXXX. He explained to me that he could do a 12 month, or 24 month installment loan at around 8 to 9 % interest, and my payments would be around {$610.00} a month on a {$6000.00} loan for the 24 months and {$6000.00} is what he said I could get when he typed in my make and model and millage.I asked how long this would take because I was on my way to work, and he said about 20-30 minutes. The amount he said, the terms and conditions, payments, interest rate, was explained to me over the phone. When I walked into the TiltleMax store, XXXX was waiting on me, and all he said he needed from me was the title, my ID ( drivers license ). He went outside and took photos of my car, sent them to someone outside the store, on a cell phone. All I did was walk in the store and sat in a chair at his desk while he was sending whatever it was he was sending, and It was taking longer than expected, then they responded and he told me they are cutting a check for {$6800.00}. He asked me if all of my information was still the same while he was waiting on whoever to respond, I told him it was.He took a photo of me.I asked about paying off the XXXX loan, and he told me the easy thing to do would be to come back in once I cashed the check. I said thats it, and he said yes and handed me the check in the amount of {$6800.00}. I assumed I would be signing paperwork, and going over paperwork, but he did n't ask me to, and I trusted everything he told me to be correct over the phone. Everything is paperless now he said. I was late for work and I had no reason to believe otherwise. When I went back to pay off my XXXX and make a payment on the XXXX, XXXX XXXX was not there, they could only find my XXXX in the system, and then they found something that said I owed $ XXXX.The manger XXXX said that he did n't know anything about my loan, and said I could call and talk with XXXX XXXX the next day and he took {$820.00} cash from me.

574908,Credit card,I used the capital one mobile application to make a payment on my capital one quicksilver credit card. I noticed a day later that they actually planned to charge me XXXX different times but assumed it was just a mistake. Capital one then charged me XXXX dollars XXXX times and XXXX dollars a third time. I called them about the charges and they said it would take XXXX business days to refund me the accidental charges. The payments overdrafted my bank account which caused me to be charged with overdraft fees since they charged me more money than I actually had in my account. I deposited XXXX dollars so I wouldnt owe as much but I am still negative XXXX.
707735,Credit card,"I had XXXX "" miles '' on my XXXX card issued by Barclays Bank , also known as Barclaycard , when they suddenly closed my account without notice and for no apparent reason. ( See Exhibit A ) When I called to inquire, the rep could n't figure out why, but said there is nothing he can do about it. 
It seems like a deceptive business practice to tell me I can earn and redeem "" miles '' then just close my account out of the blue without compensating me for the value of the rewards that I earned. 
What Barclays Bank calls "" miles '' are rewards redeemable at a rate of XXXX cent each for travel expenses charged to the card, with 10 % of them being returned to the "" miles '' balance. As you can see from Exhibit B, their website promises : "" Redeem your miles for travel statement credits, and earn 10 % miles back to use toward your next redemption. "" Thus, the value of XXXX "" miles '' would be {$1200.00}, with 10 % of the miles ( XXXX ) being returned to my account after redemption, which I could then use for another redemption of {$120.00}, making the total value after just XXXX redemptions {$1400.00}. 
It seems deceptive that Barclays Bank would encourage customers to earn these "" miles '' and then close an account without notice or reasonable cause. 
I have been an excellent customer. My FICO score has ranged between XXXX and XXXX over the past year, according to Barclaycard itself. 
I have never made a late payment, nor had a bounced payment. In fact, I generally have paid early ; Barclays Bank sends out emails, starting off "" Why wait? Make a payment now '' encouraging early payments before the due date. 
Not only have I used this card for a significant amount of my spending, but I 've also responded to their promotional enticements. For example, Barclays Bank encourages the purchase of gift cards, such as by offering XXXX ( XXXX extra points per dollar spent ) by buying XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX through their Barclays RewardsBoost online shopping portal. ( See Exhibit C ) I have done that. 
I 've been deliberately trying to earn "" miles '', and as shown in Exhibit D, Barclays Bank claims repeatedly that there is "" no limit ''. 
It is deceptive for this bank to entice people like me to use this card, accumulate a significant amount of rewards, then pull the rug out from under me. 
Their website touts "" 300 years of experience has taught us a thing or XXXX about financial services. '' It seems like whenever Barclays Bank is in the news, it 's for some sort of deceptive practices or fraud - apparently they think have become very proficient in that sort of thing. 
I will consider this matter satisfactorily settled if my account is credited for {$1400.00}, the minimum amount that my earned miles are worth if redeemed for travel statement credits."

I am having financial difficulties and requested a deferment until XX/XX/XXXX of this year but they have ignored the request and instead I am the recipient of near constant phone calls and e-mails.

77055,Credit reporting,"Hello, there is a tax lien public record with docket number XXXX with XXXX filed on XX/XX/2014 that was noted on my file that I have been trying for the last 5 months to get this entry removed. 

I have spoken with a lot of representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 3rd dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. 

I called and spoke with a supervisor and asked from Equifax on how credit bureaus verify their public records. I want to know this information because the public record keeps coming back as verified every time. I had 5 representatives inform me that the dispute is sent as a letter to the courthouse via XXXX. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. 

To make sure the correct information was processed, I contacted the court house and they educated me that they do not disclose any information via the credit bureaus. 

I decided to call Equifax back to speak with another supervisor, but this time they advised that the information is reported by the 3rd party who contacts the court house. 

I asked what information does the 3rd party give to the courthouse, and how & what kind of physical information does the 3rd party give back to the credit bureaus. They could not answer that request and just said its a form that they send over to the courthouse. 

I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus. 

Equifax refuses to give my physical documentation that they use to verify this tax lien is mine and reporting accurately per the Fair Credit Reporting Act."

302695,Credit card,"I purchased a TV on 12 months same as cash from Best Buy ( XXXX 2016 ). I provided them all my personal information when I signed up for the card. CITI is the bank that provides the Best Buy card to their customers. The first bill was sent to an address that I lived at over 5 yrs ago. I luckily called CITI customer service looking and asked them why I have not received my bill. I called looking for the bill and found out the bill was sent to the wrong address. As a result of the first bill arriving at the wrong address my payment was late. CITI reluctantly waived a {$25.00} late fee due to their error. They made the address changes and I received the XXXX bill on time and have not received any since. I contacted them today XXXX/XXXX/16 and asked why I have not been receiving a bill. I found out that they left out XXXX XXXX XXXX on my address. During the call I found out that several payments were arriving late and that I received XXXX late fees over the course of several months totaling {$87.00} in additional financing charges. 

XXXX ( my bank ) pays this bill automatically every month reoccurring on the XXXX of each month, my bill is due on the XXXX of each month. When XXXX sent my first payment that sent an electronic transfer request. I am told this is a bank to bank electronic transfer this takes 2 days. The ACH Request was declined by CITI. This resulted in XXXX having to send paper checks to CITI. XXXX is sending paper checks from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. This is a 4.5 hr. car drive ; my payments are not being received and processed until 7 to 10 days after payment is being sent. XXXX said there is no way it takes 7 to 10 days to get to the creditor given the close proximity of the XXXX locations. 

I have included a copy of the date the payment was sent and the day it was processed. None of the payment was processed on or before my due date, yet some months I do not get charges a late fee and some months I do. 

I am not being treated fairly from CITI, they should have accepted the ACH request from XXXX ( my bank ) and they would directly receive payment 2 days after it was sent. All of my payments would be received on XXXX of every month, 2 days early. 

This is a situation that I should not be in and am upset that CITI is treating me with such disrespect and are charging me for their shortcomings. 

I called CITI and was told that all this was my banks fault and that I just need to send payment earlier. I have attached a document from my bank showing the date the payment was received and the date it was processed. The dates CITI are telling me is processed are one day after my due date on the XXXX of each month. When I asked the Best Buy sales clerk if I could pay the bill electronically from my bank to the card provider I was told yes. I would have also would have been able to monitor this is Citi fixed my address correctly on the first call to them requesting the correct address to be loaded into their system. CITI is collecting a financing fee in the form of late fees due to their inability to process this bank to bank transaction. I think you should review all CITI 12 month free same as cash transaction to see if the is a wide spread problem"

Called in to the Customer Service department and experienced the following : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - one my very first call to CMS, I spoke to XXXX ( XXXX ) said my loan was in foreclosure ( I had not received any notice of this ). He stated that my recent payment would be returned and they are not able to accept any payments. I asked to speak to a Manager. He placed me on hold, returned to say he spoke to a Supervisor and there was no other information for me. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - spoke with XXXX ( XXXX ), asked immediately to speak to a Manager regarding a complaint that I had, she placed me on hold, returned, stated that she reviewed my account and asked why I was so "" angry '' the last time I called in. I was very calm when speaking to XXXX and asked her was it listed in my account that I was "" angry ''? I told her I felt labeled and did not feel I would get fair assistance if that information was listed in my account records. She stated she would transfer me to a Supervisor "" XXXX '' at ext. XXXX but she transferred me into a voicemail system loop that disconnected after trying to connect 3 times. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - spoke with XXXX ( XXXX ) who transferred me to Supervisor XXXX ( XXXX ). XXXX stated that my acct. had been flagged for foreclosure but an acct. number had not yet been set up. She stated that she was escalating to the foreclosure dept. She stated she would call me back in 48 hrs. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - spoke with XXXX ( Relationship Manager - XXXX ) who stated that the foreclosure status had been removed and I was now able to make payments. He stated that account was in past due status and payments needed to be made in certified funds and could be sent via XXXX XXXX, Wire Transfer or overnight. He quoted past due amount of {$6700.00} and stated that partial payments would be returned. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - mailed in past due amount in certified check via XXXX overnight service. Arrived and signed for on Thursday ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) by XXXX at XXXX. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - called and spoke with a rep that stated that my check was not yet in the system and instructed me to call back on the next business day - Monday ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - spoke with XXXX ( XXXX ) and she informed me that my payment had not yet been received and will be returned because it does not cover the full amount due. She stated that she could not assist me further. When I asked to speak with a Manager, she stated that there were only 2 on staff and that she could not get one of them to assist. She stated that I could be transfer to voicemail and they would call me back in 2 days. She stated there was no other department I could be transferred to and no other number I could call. She stated that CMS did not have a process in place for escalating complaints. I told her that I would rather wait for a Supervisor but she never transferred me to a Supervisor. She stated that the Supervisors were on other important calls. I told her that I would not hang up until I spoke with a Supervisor or someone that could assist me today, she then transferred me to a voicemail. 
This runaround is unacceptable and it appears that I am being treated unfairly and not provided support to ensure my account is brought current. I believe this practice is intentional so that I end up in foreclosure and lose my home. I do not believe CMS is interested in helping me bring my loan current or save my home. It appears that from the very first call into the customer service department that I was labeled and therefore not able to receive fair service/treatment."
535042,Bank account or service,"Synchrony Bank was the Bank that provided loan for the 'Car Care One ' Account I had opened to charge my balance for maintenance work on my car at XXXX in XXXX , TX . 
I have been paying Synchrony Bank through automated payments from my Checking Account. I was getting an automate call from the bank itself ( and never has it been identified in the call that there was 'collection issue ' or my account is 'delinquent ' in all the calls - almost every month on XXXX to date ). I was under the impression I was regularly paying my bill from my checking Account and my payments were all going towards my principal debt. I got suspicious today that the debt was taking too long to pay-off and when I got the call today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), instead of the regular 'automated pay ' option I was using, I selected the option to speak to the Representative and then on further discussion with her, I got the rude shock that they have been charging me a 'late fee ' of {$25.00} every alternate month without my Knowledge and to my chagrin I found that out of the {$57.00} payment I was making through these automated payments from my checking Account, {$25.00} was going to the "" Late Fee ' and only the remaining {$32.00} was going towards my "" actual payment + interest ''. 
In Total in XXXX to date, the Late Fee Charged : {$130.00} By Misleading me this way, Synchrony Bank has been racking up 43.85 % of my payments ( 25/57 * 100 ) towards 'Late Fees '. They could have clearly indicated to me in the very first automated Call I got in XX/XX/XXXX or even before in XXXX that it was a 'Collect Call ' and these calls were not for 'regular automated Payments ' but because somehow I was late on the Account. I would have setup online automated payments toward my account a different way, the way I normally pay all my other credit cards. But by misleading me this way, they deliberately seem to be indulging in this practice so that they can just get almost 44 % of my payments towards "" Late Fees ''. 

My Account # is XXXX. I had an outstanding balance of {$200.00} today morning and I made another {$60.00} towards my monthly payment of which {$25.00} was towards another late fee and only {$35.00} was towards my outstanding balance of {$200.00}. I was VERY Upset and wanted to Pay-off the whole outstanding balance of XXXX and close the Account but I did not do that as I wanted to register this Complaint and was apprehensive my complaint may not be actively adjudicated if the Account is closed. I will be paying regular payments directly ( not thru Synchrony 's automated Call ) and will keep the Account open so that this Complaint can be actively investigated thru your esteemed offices. 
Thanks very much. 
Sincerely, XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX -Cell.

57116,Debt collection,"In XXXX, 2014 I entered a written dispute with XXXX reference account number XXXX as contained on my consumer credit profile at XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Specifically alleged, ASSET ACCEPTANCE LLC was attempting to collect a debt for which I had no knowledge and alleged was fraudulently opened by an unknown XXXX party. Moreover, said account was appearing XXXX on my consumer credit profile notwithstanding the allegation of a single debt owed. 

ASSET ACCEPTANCE LLC failed to investigate, verify, or validate said debt. Although I also filed a cease and desist demand with ASSET ACCEPTANCE LLC an absolute requirement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is to report said debt as disputed pending resolution of an investigation. ASSET ACCEPTANCE LLC failed to report said debt as disputed and failed to conduct an investigation into my allegations of fraud. As such, my credit worthiness has been negatively impacted by the erroneous reporting of this account. 

A review of records compiled by the state XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Florida indicates that ASSET ACCEPTANCE LLC is not currently licensed to conduct business pursuant to section XXXX, Florida statute. As such, the imposition of this debt and the erroneous reporting to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX is an unfair and deceptive trade practice. 

Several phone calls to ASSET ACCEPTANCE LLC have met upon deaf ears. When I called to inquire on the status of the disputed account, I was advised that Florida licensing was not required. I was further advised that the debt remained due notwithstanding a lack of validation and claim of fraud. At this point the call was terminated. My written dispute remains outstanding.

This was the procedure for prior years and was noted on Ditech 's online website. XX/XX/2016, I noticed that the analysis STILL had not been done. I forwarded an email to them and the next day the analysis was finally done. The analysis showed an overage on my account which was mailed to me. The problem, in addition to being one month late, was that I had moved just as this check was mailed to me. I waited for three weeks and when the check and analysis was not forwarded by my post office, I sent an email to Ditech instructing them to stop payment on the check and issue a new one since I believed either it was lost or was being returned to Ditech. The check finally arrived a few days later and I decided to deposit the check since I had heard nothing from Ditech in reply to my email. The check cleared and I assumed the matter was settled. However, Ditech withdrew the money from my account. When I called them in early XXXX, 2016, they said they had done what I had requested. In fact, I requested a stop payment NOT a withdrawal and I told them to reissue the check and send to my new address. So they did NOT do what I had requested in my email. The withdrawal occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and as of XXXX/XXXX/2016 ( nearly two months ) I STILL have not received the replacement check. Ditech has no right to hold on to this money. I believe they are trying to float the money which is profit for them using my assets. This should be and may well be illegal. I have written them numerous emails trying to get this resolved. They, in turn, have done nothing except send form letters that they are "" reviewing my written request ''. There is nothing to "" review ''. They clearly have an obligation to give me my escrow overage money and are using stalling techniques to avoid paying me what they have owed me for over 4 months."

I obtained services from XXXX XXXX in XXXX. Upon XXXX XXXX realizing that I planned to use my insurance coverage to pay for my treatment the original bill of {$3000.00} increased. I refuse to pay the bill and disputed the amount with them. I made a dispute to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as well as made a complaint against their attorney to the XXXX. This dispute went on for over a year and XXXX XXXX refused to adjust the bill to reflect the correct amount that was owed. XXXX XXXX created fraudulent documents and forged my signature from a computer-generated app onto paperwork to reflect the price that they claim are owed. 
I informed XXXX XXXX that I would pay them the amount due but I would not pay them the inflated amount of what they were attempting to charge me which is the additional {$3000.00} over and above what they had already been paid. 
In an attempt to release XXXX, my insurance company from this dispute because this claim was over a year old and it did not appear that it was going to settle any time soon I had them to release my check in the amount of {$7800.00} which I took to Chase bank and cashed in XXXX of XXXX. This check was made out to myself and XXXX XXXX. I endorsed the check and deposited the check into my Chase Bank account. 
In XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX contacted Chase Bank, my banking Institution, and proceeded as though chase bank was their bank and my account was their account and requested {$3000.00} from the {$7800.00} check which they claim I owed them. It is unclear to me why Chase Bank would violate my privacy rights and disclose any information about my bank account, my deposits, or any of my personal banking information and involve themselves in a private dispute. Chase Bank made an unauthorized transaction from my account to pay someone an amount that is not do and owing, AND FAILED CONTACT ME. As of the date of this letter which is XXXX XXXX I have still not received anything from Chase and writing in reference to their investigation or they 're sending a {$3000.00} payment to XXXX XXXX. 
Chase performed these actions without contacting me, notifying me or including me in an investigation that went on for over 30 days regarding my personal checking account, Chase Bank determined that from the {$7800.00} check, {$3000.00} was owed to XXXX XXXX. Chase Bank sent chiro XXXX a check from my account in the amount of {$3000.00} which was returned due to insufficient funds. This put my account in the negative status {$2900.00}. 
I spoke to approximately XXXX different chase employees in an attempt to settle this matter and to get my account credited back so that it would not be in a negative. They refuse to correct the account therefore causing additional items to be returned and nonsufficient funds fees added to my account. Chase Bank has violated banking laws and Bank policy and procedure. Chase Bank has no legal authority to make a determination about an alleged dept that is in dispute. 
I am very concerned that any third-party can contact my bank, claim that I owe them, present documentation that has not been validated and authenticated to substantiate their claim, then have my bank intervene when my bank is not party to the action. This should have been handled as a civil matter, and not by Chase."
29182,Credit card,"I used a balance transfer on my Union Plus credit card to pay off other credit card.s. My minimum payment was {$25.00} a month. I made monthly payments of {$50.00} a month. XX/XX/2016 my minimum payments doubled from {$25.00} to {$56.00} a month. According to representatives XXXX and XXXX, this was because my account started accruing interest. This does not explain why my minimum payment almost doubled. I do not use this card for purchases. It was strictly to transfer a balance from another credit card. Capital One has now added late fees of {$35.00} to my account since XX/XX/XXXX which they refuse to remove."
687605,Credit card,"I have a Target credit card issued by TD Bank. I have always paid this and all of my other credit cards in full and on time. I receive my bills by e-delivery, meaning I do not get a paper statement and must sign in to my account to see my balance and transactions. At the beginning of this year, Target was having technical problems with its website. Every time I attempted to log in, I received an error message saying that there was a handshake error. Therefore, I had no idea what, if anything, I owed on my Target credit card. I had contacted Target via email to notify them that I was having problems accessing my account. 
I had attempted to reach the site via an XXXX XXXX browser on a desktop, a laptop and a mobile phone ; as well as a chrome browser on a desktop and a safari browser on my XXXX. None of the browsers were able to access the website, all were getting the handshake error. 
Each time I called the customer service center, there was an extremely long hold time and I was unable to wait to speak to a customer representative. Since I had automatic payments set up, I was n't concerned about my payment being late. 
When I finally did speak to a representative over the phone, I was told that due to a problem with my bank account, my automatic payment was returned and my account was past due. I immediately made a payment over the phone. The total amount that past due on my card was {$16.00}, and TD Bank added a returned payment fee of XXXX plus {$1.00} interest for a total amount paid over-the-phone on XXXX XXXX, 2016 of {$34.00}. I did n't realize that the automatic payment had n't processed until that very day. The representative told me that the website issues were a known problem and they were working on it. 
I later discovered that Target had reported my account payment as late to the credit reporting agencies. I immediately wrote a dispute and contacted TD Bank to ask them to correct the report because I had no way to view my statement or pay my bill since online access was unavailable. They suggested that I could have paid in store, but 1 ) I did not know in store payments were possible since I had always paid my bill online ; 2 ) I did not know that my automatic payment had n't processed ; and 3 ) I did n't know the amount due on my bill since I could not access my statement. They said they would pass my request along. 
It has been several months and my credit report still indicates that I paid my Target bill late even though it was due to circumstances that were outside my control. I recently received a letter from TD Bank indicating that they believe the report of a late payment was appropriate. However, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX requires that TD Bank provide a statement listing my charges, the amount due and the date due. Since their website was down for several weeks and I was not able to access the e-statement ( and a paper statement was not sent ) they did not fulfill this requirement. 
I am XXXX of the Target customers who was notified that my personal information was accessed in the recent breach of security. So this is another way that Target/TD Bank did not fulfill their commitments to me as a customer. Despite that, they have negatively impacted my credit score for circumstances that were totally within their control to correct by fixing the website access problems. Notably, the website now works, so it was clearly not a problem on my end. 
I would like Target to amend their credit report filing to show that my account has always been in good standing. Please contact me a.s.a.p. with any questions."
407123,Debt collection,"This individual has called me almost every single day in regards to credit card debt that I have been unable to pay due to unemployment. He leaves numerous messages. He has called my parents, my brother, and most likely other individuals that share my last name. I called him today and he threatened me by saying that if I did not pay a certain amount that legal action would be taken. He hassled me to ask family members for money. I told him NOT to call my parents as I have not lived with them for 15 years and they would not be paying this debt on my behalf."
326867,Student loan,"I 've had the displeasure of working with Navient since they were XXXX at the start of my collegiate career at XXXX. XXXX ( now Navient ) was the lender they suggested I work with. 

-From XX/XX/XXXX ( graduation ) through XX/XX/XXXX, when I was financially stable enough to begin steady payback, I was only offered Forbearance as a hardship option with capitalized interest on my private loans. Each time, I was told to apply for deferment, only to be denied in favor of forbearance without explaination. Ultimately, this capitalized interest from forbearance added over $ XXXX to my loans over the course of about XXXX months. 
-I was told multiple times by multiple reps that any "" additional '' payment would be automatically applied to principal. I found this to be false, that my extra payment instead was applied to interest. When I called to ask for an explanation, I was told that it should not have happened ... but they would not change the payment I 'd made to correct this. 
-Discussions with reps still offer varied explainations for why I would have differing amounts paid to principal each month since beginning regular, full payments in XX/XX/XXXX. 
-I have never been given a reason beyond "" you ca n't '' when asking to split additional payment toward principal amongst my loans to apply to my XXXX, higher-interest loan. I was told any extra payment that supposedly goes to principal is applied equally to all loans, preventing me from paying down my highest-interest one any quicker. 
-I still do not understand why I have a disbursement listed on my record dated XXXX months after I graduated. This is unrelated to my capitalized interest. 

Eventually, I stopped trying to contact them, and stopped trying to pay off additional principal. It became clear that their reps a ) only had access to the same information I did, b ) that they either had no power or desire to help me and my situation, and c ) that information would change from rep to rep as far as what my options/explanations were. It was not helpful to call someone and have them repeat the information I saw on my screen back to me and offer no insight. If i asked to speak to a XXXX, I would be placed on hold for a lengthy period ( expected ) and then receive the same answers from the reps ( also, expected ). 

It 's unfortunate I can only pick XXXX to "" describe my issue '' in this report, because I 've had trouble with how payments are handled, I do n't agree with fees charged, received bad information about my loans and have major problems with customer service."

The representative that I spoke with stated they do not do any blocking of accounts, she had never heard of such a thing, she further said that it was the creditor 's decision as to whether or not to block the fraud accounts, and that Experian has forwarded my complaint to the company, contingent upon what the company 's response is regarding the fraud accounts, they will adjust the fraudulent information.

Because there was a balance from the previous month ( I 'm thinking the {$15.00} ) that, even though I paid them {$3100.00} they were going to charge me interest on the {$3100.00}. In other words they are charging me interest on money that I have already paid. I asked the lady from the CC company if that was accurate and she said, yes, because the previous month 's balance was not paid in full they would use their '' trailing interest '' policy to charge me interest on money I had already paid them.

697554,Mortgage,"My VA loan was transferred form XXXX XXXX to RoundPoint mortgage on XXXX/XXXX/16. the escrow account was short and the property taxes were due. RoundPoint allowed the taxes to become delinquent and I was assessed additional interest. I paid the taxes myself on XXXX/XXXX/16 when I learned they were not paid. RoundPoint submitted a tax payment about XXXX/XXXX/16 and it was returned to RoundPoint as no taxes were due. RoundPoint did not return the refund to my escrow account, and as of XXXX/XXXX/16 my escrow funds are still not returned to my account. The second problem arose on XXXX/XXXX/16 when I discovered that my payment submitted on XXXX/XXXX/16 had not been applied. Believing that the payment had been lost in the mail, I submitted an ACH payment so I would not be assessed a late charge on my loan. On XXXX/XXXX/16 RoundPoint applied my XXXX/XXXX/16 payment, and took a full months interest and escrow charges from that payment. Since I had just made a full payment on XXXX/XXXX/16 this was a gross misapplication of my payment on XXXX/XXXX/16. RoundPoint had only earned {$17.00} interest, and my escrow account had been fully paid for the month of XXXX. All but {$17.00} should have been applied to the Principal balance on my loan, but it was not, and the lender has not contacted me to determine how I wanted the excess funds applied. Having had one bad tax experience with RoundPoint, and knowing that I am ultimately responsible for my taxes whether the lender pays them or not, I paid the first half of my 2016 taxes on XXXX/XXXX/16. RoundPoint subsequently submitted a payment for the taxes on XXXX/XXXX/16. this payment will also be returned to RoundPoint as there are no taxes due at this time.

2 ) My on line XXXX 2016 statement shows a principal balance of {>= $1,000,000}, the following month 's on line statement shows a principal balance of {$68000.00} a difference of {$1000.00}. I contacted DiTech via phone and email regarding this discrepancy. They sent me a letter via e-mail indicating my account will be reviewed and a written response would be provided with the 30 days of receipt of my email of XXXX XXXX, 2016. Additionally on XXXX/XXXX/16 I faxed a copy of my XXXX 2016 on line statement to DiTech ; clearly noting the principal balance of {$67000.00} this according to my records is the accurate amount. 
Yesterday, on XXXX XXXX I called DiTech once again, spoke with a supervisor, named XXXX. I relayed my issues of concern again.

The result of their audit shows the principal balance remains as {$68000.00}, a figure I do not agree with. 
XXXX shared the following : mailed statements vs. on line statements do not have the same figures. This is due to the maintenance of my account and payments being reallocated to principal.

654602,Mortgage,"Good Morning All, I wish to have these very important & relevant questions answered by the Plaintiff, Wilmington Trust, the entity claiming to be the holder of my mortgage note that was allegedly sold on the secondary market XX/XX/XXXX by the servicer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX ( loan originator as well ). The Plaintiff in its sole capacity claims the mortgage was sold into the deal XXXX at some point between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. Your office retains a copy of the note with endorsements. Please note that XXXX did not exist any longer in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX for failure to file annual returns with Secretary State of WA. This means that first endorsement on the note was fraudulent in nature as the entity had DIED, but purports to be assigned to a trust well into the future before its creation. The same holds true for the XXXX endorsement. I see nothing that indicates that these endorsements reference Successor By Merger! That is just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more to discuss. So we have an entity claiming they have legal standing to foreclose as they claim they are holder of the note. The agreements between themselves are ridiculous & have no merits for the homeowner to legitimately track their COT ( Chain of Title ) at the recorders office. They simply do not match! They can fabricate their agreements at anytime amongst themselves which allows for further deceptive fraud against the homeowners ( FYI XXXX and XXXX ). My case is not going to be used to set favorable precedence for any bank entity to help them steal other homes in the judicial arena in the state of Washington. I will absolutely MAKE SURE this WILL NOT happen. I am a responsible individual and also a steward of the state and the public should be aware of various facts that surround this case so they understand what is at stake. To not know would otherwise be harmful to the public. IF ONLY THEY REALLY KNEW! I wish to know the trust balance specifically related to my property. I wish to have a NOD stating amount owed and to whom I am actually in default to. Now what would be the reason why a valid and legal NOD would not be given to me? Can anyone guess? I just want to compare the balance in the trust to what the complaint indicates. Simple, right? Furthermore, I wish to know how the Servicer ( XXXX XXXX who claimed they sold all their rights & interest XX/XX/XXXX ) continues to make assignments on behalf of themselves and XXXX, well after the trust date closed? As your own XXXX XXXX said to me : How did the entity get the loan out of the trust to make further assignments after that date? My response to that is : PERHAPS they are double and triple dipping. Fraud on the homeowner, fraud on the investors, SEC violations! PERHAPS, JUST PERHAPS the asset never really left XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. What do you think XXXX and XXXX. I am onto all possibilities and realities to be proven in a court of law of course. BUT, I am not the Plaintiff that bares the burden of proof. Does n't mean I can not disprove what WT states. Let us not forget about the XXXX Manual ( the attorneys manual for foreclosures ). Last, it is quite obvious that XXXX XXXX is behind it all and I have felt this. They need to show me what they did with approximately {$150000.00} in payments made direct to them after my XX/XX/XXXX Chapter XXXX BK DISCHARGE, where mortgage was not re-affirmed, but yet I, XXXX . Homeowner exercised GOOD FAITH in paying them as I have always INTENDED on keeping my family home in which my husband himself built and we used some of our own money. Now comes the NPV issue. So we have a Trustee for a Trust claiming I owe X amount of dollars. But yet they can not even provide me a NOD to match the amount & entity on their complaint? WHY NOT? What 's it going to hurt? Could the Plaintiff state the actual amount owed to the Senior Beneficiary? In this case, it appears to be investors for a trust."

Nationstar assumed my mortgage one month before I sold the house, and when I called them to ask if they were going to do an autopayment, they said no, to send the mortgage check, which I did.

After it was determined that we would not be able to make all our payments for the month, we decided to put our student loans into forbearance. But for whatever reason, the loan payments were posted to our account on Tuesday, putting our checking account into overdraft. There were multiple other payments that were posted ( that I could not cancel, because they were pending ) on Wed and Thurs. By Thurs morning, the damage had been done. A total of ( XXXX ) {$36.00} overdraft fees were charged to my account. I 've worked with my bank to dispute the loan payments that were made in error. With PNC 's track record, I am confident that a few of these transactions were processed in such an order to maximize fees, such as was done to me previously this year. Because of the {$250.00} in fees I now do not have the funds for my car payment, and will be in the negative again next month ( perpetual cycle of abuse ) because I am on a fixed income. It 's a snowball effect, and we are being overwhelmed. This is abuse!!! We have our first child on the way and are trying to move into a cheaper apartment, and PNC is interfering with our attempts at a reasonable life! How long will the abuses continue?

I called Customer Service yet again today to ask them to explain the letter and point me to the statement that contained the applied credit. I spoke with customer rep "" XXXX '' who told me that the letter was not in error-that it referred to when I opened the dispute. Clearly the letter says nothing of the sort. She absolutely would not concede that the letter was in error in stating that the credit was applied to my account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. 
Noting it was clearly futile to argue the point, it is clear to me that this is an effort to XXXX on the part of Synchrony Bank in anticipating a complaint investigation. I highly resent these tactics, given the time and consternation this has caused me in this matter. A simple "" mea culpa '' admission and correcting the matter would suffice.

Recently I read a federal finding darting to XX/XX/2014 in which it explained then the practice of mis-recording payments to make it appear that the account was late. If that was not recognized by the person paying the account the loan could fall into default. 
This has happened to me throughout my payment process with Great Lakes. They have given me loan numbers to write on checks changing them a number of times. 
Last month I filed a complaint with Great Lakes but I feel it is of the utmost importance for you t have this knowledge."

The house had a offer within two weeks of being placed on the market. I contacted Chase to see if I qualified for the HAFA/Relocation assistance. The Chase representative looked into my account and told me I was eligible for the HAFA assistance at the full amount of {$10000.00}. My realtor has been very timely in sending Chase all documents needed for the short sale. Since the offer has been submitted in XX/XX/2016 Chase has been dragging their feet in this process. Now the HAFA/relocation program has expired XX/XX/2016 and Chase is telling me I no longer qualify for relocation assistance, even when my home was listed and going through the process prior to the XX/XX/2016 expiration date.

717949,Mortgage,"I filed a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy in XXXX. It was confirmed in XXXX of XXXX. My Mortgage with XXXX was included in the bankruptcy. They were allowed payments under the plan in the amount of {$830.00}. I began making payments in XXXX XXXX. After making payments for about XXXX years, which were always paid and reported as on time, I was informed that SPS would be the servicer on the account and that I would be making payments to them. I promptly began paying SPS in XXXX of XXXX. I was under the impression that everything was going perfectly with my reorganization and to my knowledge I had perfect credit given the fact I had always made ontime payments and in fact had paid payments of principle and interest ahead. I have kept everything on time with my bankruptcy never making any late payments to any of my creditors. I am now in the process of trying to get another loan. When my credit was pulled, we found that SPS is reporting fluctuating, with no apparent pattern, consistent late pay of XXXX and XXXX days. I promptly disputed with all XXXX credit reporting agencies. I was informed that SPS had confirmed that it was being reported correctly and my only option at this point was to contact them. I called SPS. They told me that in fact they could not see any missed payments and they did not have an answer. They told me they did not have a "" full '' accounting and would have to "" order '' the payment history from the prior servicer.Nothing makes sense, yet they insist they are reporting correctly. This has ruined my credit and I have been denied the loan solely because of this misreporting. I was told that the quickest way for it to report "" on time '' would be to make the XXXX payments that were showing late and it would immediately, as of XXXX that night, show current. I was told I could still keep the dispute going but that would fix the problem in the short term. Because I am trying to get the company that I am trying to get a loan from to reconsider, that is what I did. That is not what happened though. I paid a payment of {$1700.00} and explained to the person taking the payment that it was for XXXX payments of principle and interest. This is what I was instructed to do by the supervisor at SPS. After paying the payment of {$1700.00}, which was XXXX payments when I called to check the account, the funds were mis-applied, only one payment was credited and the account is still showing delinquent. I have attached my history and it is just as I said, I have consistently paid my payments to them and in fact I am ahead on payments. Since SPS took over the loan in XXXX XXXX, they were entitled to XXXX payments to date of {$830.00}. I have made to date, XXXX payments total which I have attached proof of, with the exception of the last {$1700.00}. I can provide proof of that payment as well if needed. After pointing out the history of the account to the representative I was told that even though it was in fact showing consistent payments, there was nothing he could do. I am at my wits end. I have done everything required by me and have abided by all of the guidelines set forth by my Ch XXXX, yet SPS, even though I have paid as required has found a way to continue to defraud the system to continually ruin my credit. To date, because of this misreporting by SPS, which apparently they are not offering any way for it to ever be fixed, I have been turned down for a loan and I am having to pay XXXX interest rate for a car loan. In closing I would appreciate any help you could possibly give to finally clear my credit of the false late pay reportings. I have provided documents,"
587868,Mortgage,Residential Credit Solutions Inc who was recently put under Consent Order by the CFPB continues its abusive debt collection activities illegally foreclosing on my property.
333132,Mortgage,"I am a XXXX working with the borrower in question in Oregon 's foreclosure mediation program. Within this program, the borrower has submitted two packets for which Bank of America conducted two modification reviews. Both reviews led to denials, one dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and one dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The denial reason given each time was "" We 're unable to verify your qualifying income ''. 

Both denials were issued in clear and direct violation of 12 CFR Part 1024 ( Regulation X ) Subpart C 1024.41 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( i ) ( B ) which states that as a servicer, Bank of America was obligated to "" Notify the borrower in writing within 5 days ( excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays ) after receiving the loss mitigation application that the servicer acknowledges receipt of the loss mitigation application and that the servicer has determined that the loss mitigation application is either complete or incomplete. If a loss mitigation application is incomplete, the notice shall state the additional documents and information the borrower must submit to make the loss mitigation application complete and the applicable date pursuant to paragraph ( b ) ( 2 ) ( ii ) of this section. The notice to the borrower shall include a statement that the borrower should consider contacting servicers of any other mortgage loans secured by the same property to discuss available loss mitigation options. '' Upon receipt of the initial packet, no such notification was sent to the borrower with regard to its completeness, nor was any notification submitted to the Oregon Foreclosure Avoidance Program document portal. There is no evidence whatsoever that Bank of America took any steps in determining the completeness of the packet before issuing either of the two denial letters. The reason the issue of completeness or incompleteness is pertinent to this case is that Bank of America essentially issued a denial due to the fact that the packet was incomplete. This is a brazen violation of the above guideline, and the fact that it happened on two consecutive reviews leads me to believe that Bank of America 's loss mitigation procedures are now wholly out of line with CFPB guidelines. 

When I initially communicated to Bank of America that the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was improper, the borrower was told to submit a new packet and was given indications for how to present verifiable income. This, to be clear, should have taken place within 5 days of packet submission and should NOT have been requested after a denial had been issued. The borrower complied with all requests, including submitting a rental agreement in her name, rental deposits to her bank account, and providing documents supporting her XXXX income. After satisfying all of the requests and submitting a new packet, she was denied for a second time without a single notification as to why the supplied income documents could not be verified. 

Through these two reviews, Bank of America has demonstrated a flagrant disregard for the modification review processes laid out by the CFPB. Worst of all, my client submitted two separate packets before the XXXX, and because they were rushed to denial due to Bank of America cutting corners, my client may no longer be eligible for HAMP. 

At this juncture, we have been told that the borrower must submit an appeal to be reviewed for HAMP. We plan to submit the appeal, but to this day we have no clear idea of what documents would be needed to verify income. Bank of America was obligated to communicate this to us within 5 days of receipt of the initial packet in XXXX XXXX, and was again obligated to do so upon receipt of the second packet in XXXX XXXX. Bank of America 's blatant disregard for my client 's right to a fair modification review should be thoroughly researched by the CFPB, as it is no doubt an ingrained practice within the Bank of America 's loss mitigation team."

Again her answer was that does n't matter! She also said I have to make the payment on the phone now to avoid the payment being 30 days late which will cost me another {$11.00}? How can they say thank you for the payment, send you a confirmation # and say thank you for your payment and the recording when you call says a payment was made on XXXX/XXXX/16 and STILL charge you a late fee? Also why was I never emailed saying there was an error please call or visit the website? What if I did n't view my checking account online and waited for the bank statement to come to balance my account? Is this even legal? I would also like to note that I will only pay online now because I had a past late fee and US BANK said they did n't receive my payment in the mail until after the due date? It was being sent to a location only XXXX state away from me. US Bank claimed they did n't receive it until after the due date.. I sent the payment in 12 days before the due date.

Upon my return home several weeks later, I was surprised to find a mail notification from XXXX advising that the proceeds were transferred prior to maturity, resulting in an early withdrawal penalty of {$2400.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX erroneously processed the transfer requests immediately, approximately 5 days and 13 days before maturity. He did not wait until after the maturity dates as he agreed to do.

However, IMC Credit Services, obtained some of our accounts receivable that were inaccurate, had incorrect itemized statements, or for items that our insurance had already paid.

450836,Mortgage,"The following is my response to the JP Morgan Chase continued regurgitation of "" facts '' that have no merit. I thank Senator XXXX of Connecticut for his attention to this ongoing problem with this institution. 
"" Office of US Senator XXXX XXXX Re : Fraud Alert on Chase Mortgage Modification # XXXX Dear Senator XXXX : We thank you for your actions, continued interest on the above fraud alert and as promised will provide XXXX with an update, per our conversation this morning. 
Firstly, JP Morgan Chase ( "" Chase '' ) response via the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to our fraudulent charges was received on or about XXXX XXXX, XXXX : dated XX/XX/XXXX. At best, Chase 's response was totally unsatisfactory, after more than a year of delays. Chase merely regurgitated their previous claims and left many unanswered questions. Furthermore, Chase has knowingly and intentionally showed bad faith in our discourse and need to come clean on the following unsatisfactorily-unanswered questions : 1. Chase claimed in their XXXX XXXX, XXXX correspondence that they performed XXXX home inspections during our mortgage modification process. Utterly false! 
2. Chase does not have proper systems in place to handle customers ' most valuable assets - their mortgage. During the mortgage modification process, I spoke with XXXX Chase Representatives and can document this. As a direct result there was absolute chaos and confusion. For example, I spoke with and there is faxed transmission on or about XXXX XXXX, XXXX, to XXXX XXXX, Chase Representative, about the confusion and payments for the verbal trial mortgage. He confirmed that there was no packet, no information on record sent on our verbal trial plan. Furthermore, he said there was no notification of any foreclosure on my account, and if there was any, he would advise that the modification be submitted again. 
Of course, Chase 's version is very different with claims of breach letters that we herewith request. My question is : if Chase can not be trusted on something as simple as their phantom claims of home inspections, why should we believe them in a Byzantine process where it took 2 years & XXXX of their representatives for just a mortgage modification? 

3. Furthermore, why did Chase employ a verbal mortgage system for the most precious transaction for customers? Could this be subject to confusion, misrepresentation, fraud and customer abuse? Is this verbal system still used by Chase and if not why and when was it discontinued? 
4. Example # 2, on the chaos and confusion of the verbal plan. Chase 's own senior representative, their VP, Assistant General Counsel, sent documentation to me on or about XXXX XXXX, to prove Chase 's case on their "" mistake-proof-verbal mortgage. The documents only further embarrassed Chase in that their so call "" approved '' plan would put us in default, even before we would reasonably receive proper documentation to start the plan. 
5.Chase 's settlement offer, shortly thereafter of {$15000.00} to resolve our case was an insult amount considering our loss through Chase 's incompetence, confusion, fraud and unconscionable charges to complete our modification. As a direct result, we promptly turned down Chase 's offer. 
6. We have heard repeatedly from reliable sources that Chase designed a verbal mortgage program to confuse customers & trigger foreclosures. The process was fraught with difficulty and onerous paperwork : multiple reps to virtually prevent paperwork to be completed "" in good order. '' Most disturbing, we heard from insiders that Chase incentivized its staff to trigger foreclosures in the process because this was more profitable to the bank. The idea of incentivizing your own staff to defraud customers is vicious, illegal and intolerable at best. We stand by this statement that Chase paid commission to staff for each home foreclosure"

I asked that everything that the company did for my loan be sent to a lender who I trusted to look over everything and Now 7 months down the company is telling me they are not closing my loan and that the company is not renewing their license for the XX/XX/XXXX year. Apparently, there seems to be a lot of fraudulent activities that has been going on with the employees or persons for International City Mortgage.

I received no answer and the woman was very rude. I have now paid XXXX to my escrow account from XX/XX/XXXX-present. Despite the 12 months time line, I am still paying the extra XXXX per month. My taxes, PMI, and insurance this year totaled XXXX. I have called XXXX times and requested a full escrow breakdown. I have yet to receive XXXX. I have absolutely no idea what my additional payments of XXXX have gone towards. In addition to this, Carrington has begun holding an overage payments I make towards principal. They hold it in an "" unapploed funds account '' as a "" suspense balance ''. Currently, I have XXXX in this account. I have been told they will only move those money if my account is current. Oddly, my account has been current, the funds have not been applied. I assume I am paying interest on my XXXX of principal balance. I exhausted with this company. My minimum payment rose from XXXX to XXXX, and XXXX per month raise is substantial for me as a single mother. I have paid almost XXXX to escrow this calendar year, all that has been paid out of my escrow is XXXX in PMI and insurance, yet my most recent statement shows an escrow balance of XXXX. How?!?! I can not get an answer. My XXXX requests for full escrow breakdown resulted in XXXX rude conversations with XXXX different reasons why I am paying almost XXXX per year to escrow and NO escrow breakdown. A year and a half in, I still have never gotten an escrow breakdown. Nor have I found out when and where my "" suspense balance '' is applied. Please help, I beyond frustrated. I can not afford to continue paying XXXX per month on a loan of XXXX with a fixed 6.5 % rate."

158525,Credit card,My interest rate is too high on my credit card. I have asked Capital One to lower the interest rate so that my payments can be affordable. Capital one stated that since I had payments returned to my bank that I am not eligible for an APR decrease. They have also sent me some things about my payment being so expensive because of my XXXX insurance. I do n't have a problem with the XXXX insurance being added to my payment. My concern is that I have such a high APR rate. I have had a card with Capital One for at least XXXX years. My question is ... There is n't XXXX time that my account was not in good standing for Capital One to decrease my APR in XXXX years? It seems very odd to me.
231640,Consumer Loan,"I had a car loan through PNC and after being talked into making them my primary bank, opened an account with them. On two separate occasions, several months apart, they initiated payments from that account as I was behind on my payment ; but the funds were not available on either occasion and they generated overdraft fees. I choose to no longer keep funds in the account and switched my direct deposit back to XXXX. The account was a requirement for payments on my car loan so I maintained, but they started charging monthly charges which I was not going to pay. Rather than reverting the account to the free account I had initially requested, they charged off the account. While all this was going on I entered my final semester in college and had trouble obtaining my financial aide and was again behind on my payments. They contacted me when I was 2-3 months behind on my payments ; I attempted to inform them that I would make a partial ( half-month ) payment, followed by a repeat of the same in 2 weeks, and a full payment on the next due date to reduce my delinquency. I was told that only a full payment would be accepted and that repossession would be attempted. No resolution was reached. When I received my financial aid a month later I attempted to make my account current. The checking account had been closed and I had no path to make my payments. I called the local branches on multiple occasions, was connected to non-local branches on multiple occasions, went into the local branch, called the auto loan branch and there was no one willing to accept my payments, nor to simply reopen the checking account to let me then post my payment. Just short of two months later the car loan was closed in a defaulted standing. When approached by the auto loan/reclaim department of PNC, I was offered a repayment offer that would give me a lower monthly installment ( & lt ; $ XXXX/month ), which was not much of a shift from the original setup ( $ XXXX/month ... I always made payments of $ XXXX/month ). The intent was to "" reboot '' my loan, while not removing any of the default reportings on my credit. So go back to the status quo, but have a far less chance of refinancing with another loaner to get away from those that I now had sour business dealings with. I opted to make no payments and not divulge the location of my vehicle and now 2 years later ( with no payments! ). I approached the bank with a settlement option, {$3600.00} on the $ XXXX+ that was the remaining balance, no interest would be accepted on my part as I did not feel it was fair or in my best interest to include them in the base evaluation. My account has now been reported as paid in full on my credit report."

Ten years ago The State of California Department of Rehabilitation and I entered into an agreement that they would retool me for working from home.

My XXXX conditions worsened, and the State of California released XXXX XXXX individuals ( I being one of them ) from its program to "" save money '' for the State ( at that time in bad fiscal condition ). My Federal Loans were forgiven as part of my deteriorating XXXX situation, but Sallie Mae would not forgive my loans based on the fact that I knew I was XXXX when I applied for the loan ( even though that was not a factor in the application ). When I explained that my health had continued to disintegrate, they refused to accept this despite letters from my medical providers. My loan continues to grow with fees. I have no savings or any means to repay XXXX or settle with them. Also, I now have the XXXX loan on my credit report.

Therefore, Wells Fargo is apparently deceiving their customers by stating the rate is 8.248 percent and then doing a bait and switch and saying the person is approved at 12 % ( with Excellent credit! ). 

I refused the loan, since I can get a 12 % loan anywhere and the whole purpose of the loan was to lower interest rate but wanted to let the CFPB know of this unfair and deceptive practice."

452122,Mortgage,"I have had a horrible experience with my mortgage from BB & T from the start. However, this latest issue has really frustrated me. My intention from the start has been to pay {$1600.00} towards my loan, XXXX a month. My monthly payment is around {$2700.00} and the remainder is to be used to reduce the principle. The reason why I am paying XXXX a month is to reduce the interest that accrues on my loan. After contacting the bank today, I learned that they do not apply my {$1600.00} payment to the balance of my loan until the full monthly payment is received. The money sits in a "" suspense account ''. Therefore, I do not pay less interest at all. However, BB & T has my cash that they can use to invest and earn profits for themselves!!! Their customer service told me that their system is not set up to support bi-monthly payments. 
However, on top of all of that, BB & T sold my personal information to multiple organizations. Since closing I have received multiple letters in the mail from different companies offering to help me pay my mortgage and suggesting that I consider making bi-monthly payments because it will reduce my overall lifetime mortgage cost. It is just wrong that BB & T does not offer bi-monthly payments to their customers but will sell your information to other companies offering to do just that! 

This is just a fraction of my issues with BB & T. In addition, they lost my original loan paperwork with all of my personal information on it. To date I have received no follow-up on that issues, so as far as I know it 's still lost. And, I had a horrible experience with my mortgage loan officer who was incompetent and incredibly rude. I would refinance in a heartbeat if it were n't so costly!"
190984,Credit card,"XXXX - the cellular service provider made a series of unauthorized charges. Attempts to contact and resolve failed as they did not pick-up calls and did not respond to emails ( receipt of which they acknowledged ). Few of the charges they credited back, but several remained unresolved. Barclays Bank, as instructed by them, was called and dispute and request for chargeback were made. The bank attempted to contact the merchant by phone but failed. As usual with that Bank - they DID NOT DEMAND DOCUMENTATION FROM THE MERCHANT. The bank, as I experienced previously, demanded from me that the account be closed and new credit card numbers be issued. That is not acceptable nor is it authorized way of resolving billing disputes. This bank does it for years and I experienced it many times. This bank does not follow Fair Credit Billing Act and their employees are trained to push back and force customers to declare fraudulent transaction by an unknown actor in order to force the change of the card number. That is neither true nor legal. 
The dispute and chargeback process has the ability to correct banks behaviour. Changing the credit card number punishes the consumer as this forces the change of card number in many other places where the consumer might have set-up recurring charges. 
The offense by the bank is not only in abusing FCBA, but also in machinations to delay the process. The dispute was setup on XXXX, on XXXX I received the denial letter ( without any documentation ) demanding that I authorize closure of the account - but the letter was dated XXXX, and the bank did not mail it until XXXX."

I called them and told this is totally illegal and I am being harrassed by this. Their response was that they were being audited and found out that my loan was supposed to change to XXXX % and they missed it and they wo n't charge me for repayment of XXXX years that I was on XXXX %. They did this so they know I wo n't be able to afford this payment so they can foreclose on my home.

I thought this "" charge card '' was a novel idea and the middle ground between a debit card and credit card. Well after having the "" charge card '' for a little over 2 months they add a "" Pay it Later '' option which is effectively making it a credit card. Why does this company ruin a good thing?

They also knew that they could not retroactively reapply it back to XXXX as that practice had been deemed "" deceptive and in violation of FDCPA by the United States District Court ( See XXXX ). The courts are wrongfully allowing these and many other contradictions to the court rules showing bias for the debt collector. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the district court allowed them to renew the default judgment ex-parte without meeting any of the specified criteria like attempting to serve me first, etc. Most importantly, they are ignoring that the judgment that they were allegedly renewing was invalid, because it had never been signed by a judge or clerk. I know that it is also against federal law for them to collect on an invalid judgment and to fraudulently manipulate the interest. I hope that you will act to see that this invalid judgment is set aside."

125890,Mortgage,"Last year I contacted Sterus, Inc. about my inability to contact them with regard to my mortgage modification I have with them, I was not receiving documentation and was unable to send communication or speak with key departments, such as escrow or insurance. After about three months of this last year, the communication was fixed and I did receive my documents and the link on my account with this company seemed to be corrected. 
In XXXX, 2015, I contacted customer service to discuss my insurance which is included in my payments, actually thinking I was speaking to Seterus, Inc., but in fact was speaking to an outsourced divison in NC. In any event, they failed to take down my notes on insurance changes and no one got back to me. My new agent tried to handle this for me and they refused. I was trying to reduce the cost of my insurance to keep my payments the same or lower because I am on a low income. The current insurance company continued to raise their rates and its almost XXXX a year. I found a company to do the same thing for XXXX. After the phone call from my new agent, I called to speak to Seterus and they advised that an escrow analysis is currently under way which means that the negligence of the call center may cost me my house. Also I have notified the company more than once, that it was my intention to change insurance to keep costs down. So today when I called I was upset to find out not only did they refuse to pay the new insurance, they had paid the old one early. In speaking to the insurance department ( customer service did not help me at all here either ), I found that if approved the new insurance it would create a deficit in the escrow that would drive my payment up to an amount I could never afford. I needed to send a message to the escrow department to either hold the escrow analysis for a month or simply ask their advice on this matter since it is their common practice and it does DIRECTLY IMPACT MY MONTHLY PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT WITH SETERUS. 
I asked the supervisor ( XXXX XXXX ) to notate his refusal to contact the escrow department, or his refusal to make notes for the escrow department and also to contact yet again the IT department for the website, so I can send a letter via email to Seterus. 
I need to speak with them directly to clarify how to handle this expeditiously and keep my payment down. It just seems to me that they are trying to take my home."

I have contacted them several times and even wrote letters to them and the credit bureaus disputing this to no avail. They claim that even though it has an incorrect email address that 's not mine, the social security number matches and therefore it is a legitimate. I am not contesting the validity of the debt, just the validity of my attachment to it. They refuse to work with me, they refuse to acknowledge their own lack of due diligence and they refuse to even work with the payments to even make it manageable so I can avoid negative credit reporting and late payments while this is sorted out.

409786,Mortgage,"Thank you so much for responding to my complaint. But nothing in that response said anything that happen in XXXX. Yes I was approved for my XXXX modification in XXXX after I filed Bankruptcy. In XXXX I received my check back from you guys and I called and the rep from Bank of America ( bofa ) said they could n't find my Modification ( Mod ) paperwork. They said they can not accept any more payment until they find it. As we wait for the process. I received a call stating that they found it and also I 'm APPROVED for a Principal reduction. She also stated that she will be sending my paperwork for me to sign. 
Question : Where is the paperwork, I 've called every XXXX days until the end of XXXX and everyone kept telling me it 's on it way. Also XXXX time I called they said the department is closed down. So it will take a little longer. Now since this was going on of course the payments are falling behind. Yes I filed a complaint to my Attorney General office about speaking to so many different people and getting different answers. That 's why in XXXX they gave me XXXX person to speak too. So my question to Bank of America why you guys gave me the run around and then you knew by me applying for a XXXX modification within XXXX years that I was going to be denied. Also when I was already approved for themodification that you guys lost but then found. Why you guys did not give me the proper paperwork for the Principal reduction. I really think for the year of XXXX sounds very odd. And I was misled as a customer seeking for help. XXXX bank of American should had kept my check and not sent it back.

Progressive mgmt systems."
671066,Student loan,"My problems with ACS Education Financing are too numerous to summarize effectively but I will try my hardest : Customer ServiceEasily some of the worst I 've ever experienced. Their website is slow and old. I ca n't easily access information such as contact info, documents, payments, etc. It 's a functional atrocity. The only online convenience they offer is payment, but sending in and processing forms must still be done by hand and postal mail. If I need to call they have limited hours, based on eastern time ( So living on the west coast makes it even more inconvenient for me ). 
If I email, send a payment, or basically try to contact them in any capacity it takes XXXX days for a response/acknowledgement. That 's IF they choose to respond. There have been numerous times where my payments simply did n't go through since their system just does n't make much sense. 
If I do get responses, it 's usually with major attitude. They try to state the obvious and make me feel dumb and beneath them. They also try to imply that I say things I did not ( even though almost all my correspondence is in email form and I can easily go back and copy/paste my responses ). 
My last correspondence with them resulted in them sending me the wrong paperwork I needed,, acknowledging receipt in email, saying they will process within XXXX business days, and me having to contact them XXXX business days ( XXXX weeks later ) only to receive the, "" You have the wrong form '' response. 
Last year it took them XXXX months to file a deferment on my accounts. XXXX MONTHS. Of which I assumed they had already applied it. They never contacted me to say my accounts were delinquent when they should have been in deferment, resulting in me and my cosigner with giant hits on our credit reports, and only after repeatedly complaining and threatening with a lawsuit did anyone ever respond to me that had an actual email address and extension. Even then it was thrilling if she even acknowledged my existence. 

Handling my accountMy account has been bought and sold countless times so far. The original lender is bankrupt. They sold off assets to XXXX companies, who bankrupted and sold to XXXX, who sold it back to those companies, who sold it some mysterious company named XXXX XXXX. When I received notices of these actions, it was just barely in time to question them. When I questioned the sale to XXXX and sending a debt validation request, only ACS responded with old information from the first lender. This also took them an incredible amount of time, yet somehow just shy of the deadline for such requests. 
I was also denied a response when I asked them to tell me why my interest rates change up and down so drastically. No clear answer on that, just pages of numbers and math XXXX XXXX would have trouble with. Of course I ca n't even contact this XXXX XXXX, only ACS will handle things. 

Other things : They have also called my cosigner, my mother, and said some nasty things to her, all because someone made a mistake on their end with handling payments and repayment periods. Not appreciated at all. 
If I have to talk to a collections officer, they are very rude and leave indecipherable voicemails to call them back ( at my inconvenience ). Again, not appreciated. The level of hostility is too much, and they seem to not be able to coordinate between their accounts and billing departments. 

I think I have most of it here. I have to admit I have become hostile as well a couple of times, but my level of tolerance versus the frustration is extreme here. It takes a lot to tick me off that badly. So yeah, someone should check them out, or come talk to me, I 'd love to have a great conversation with the federal government about how I 'm treated."
12264,Mortgage,"I complained about the same situation a couple of years ago. Ocwen sent fictitious records which they will probably do again. I have a mortgage being serviced by Ocwen. I have been dealing with this issue since XXXX. I have been harrassed, threatened foreclosure, They stated I owed them XXXX dollars at one point then I got an attorney and they stated less just three weeks ago they said I owed them XXXX, A week later XXXX. This week we are at XXXX. My lawyer was costing more than the equity so I dropped them and I am back to square one. Bad credit, stress and unable to obtain financial peace of mind. I had the loan originaly serviced by Indymac even though it was the same company it changed to OCWEN. Indymac had sold my loan while having errors. I disputed the errors to OCWEN. I asked them to respect RESPA but to know available remedy. OCWEN does not have a representative to talk to each representative regergetated the amount shown on their computer and when fees where assessed I had no other remedy other than to complain or pay the ballooned balance and eroneous fees or suffer the consequences. Since I am writing this, It can be assumed that I chose to suffer the stress, humilation and embarassment of being chastised by my work as OCWEN called or by being harrassed by the representative. OCWEN upon assuming the loan also began to charge me exessive amounts on my escrow account. They have now stopped accepting my payments as they have done before. They have returned three payments that happened to be the only payments that I have missed during this tenure. I offered them a settlement of XXXX. They accepted however they stated that the loan must be paid off by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I obtained a loan from XXXX I explained that it was a settlement and they agreed to work fast. The loan was ready to go all they needed the bank to say was this was a settlement and the loan will be considered paid in full. Every phone call to OCWEN from XXXX XXXX repeatedly stopped the loan by telling the processor that it was a short sale and that the home was in foreclusore. Each time I called the representative they stated that it is not so that it was a settlement. XXXX XXXX attempted to contact OCWEN with the same results that I have had for 9 years. Different representatives and unable to confirm that the property was not in foreclosure or short sale. After the date expired I recieved a letter explaining that they had offered a short sale. Even though I am the original owner who they were offering the settlement to."
307236,Bank account or service,"On XX/XX/2016 I went directly into a Chase local branch. I submitted a claim against a merchant who drafted {$410.00} from my bank account without authorization. When I went in to the local branch on XXXX, a representative filed a claim on my behalf. She stated to me that I would receive a provisional credit within 24 hours while they investigated the fraud claim. 

72 hours after my visit to the branch, I called Chase because I did not see a provisional credit like I was supposed to see. This was the first problem I had with this claim. I spoke with a representative who stated that the case was closed because I had supposedly told the representative when filing a claim that I allowed someone to use my card. This is simply not true. There are only XXXX employees in my company and all XXXX of us have our own individual business debit cards therefore there would be absolutely no reason for anybody to allow anyone else to use their own personal card. That was the second issue I had with Chase regarding this claim. 

After speaking more with the representative named XXXX, I explained to her that even the merchant themselves did not know why the charge was made and that it was wrongful and that I would be receiving a reimbursement back from them. Unfortunately, the reimbursement never came. XXXX then stated that she would be re-opening the case with the proper claim filing and that everything should be good to go. It was n't. Instead of everything being good to go, I get a fax on XX/XX/XXXX stating that the case had been resolved and that it was closed ... This was the third problem I had with Chase. I then call again to try and figure out what is going on and why I had n't received my provisional credit or why Chase keeps claiming my case was closed and I speak to a claims escalations senior representative by the name of XXXX. XXXX stated after our conversation that they had already contacted XXXX themselves directly and that they were giving the merchant 15 days from when I filed my initial claim on XX/XX/XXXX to reimburse me my money or else XXXX had approved a charge back and I would get my money back the day after XX/XX/XXXX. I did n't. That was the XXXX problem I had with Chase. 

I waited patiently a few more days since XX/XX/XXXX was a Friday and I figured I would get my money back by Monday the next week. Monday came and went. On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I call back and I am being given the runaround and am being told by Chase that they ca n't speak with me about this claim because I did n't give proper identifying information .... how convenient. Unfortunately for them I was fed up. I muscled my way to another escalations manager by the name of XXXX who is trying to tell me that my claim was never handled because I allowed someone to use my card ... again I muscled my way through that XXXX reason and got her to state that she would have to submit a claim because it was not submitted properly. I informed her that the claim was submitted on 3 prior occasions and if she means to tell me that I had to file a fourth claim that I was going to be filing a complaint against them with the OCC and the C.F.P.B. After a 40 minute conversation I finally got her to state that she is filing another claim and that I would receive my provisional credit within 12 business hours. It 's a shame that I no longer believe anything they say. Because I have had to spend close to 6 actual man hours attempting to get this resolved and have had to speak to multiple representatives who all had different answers and responses, I must file this complaint against Chase to you so that you hopefully see that what they are doing is ridiculous and outright wrong. Filing a claim of fraudulent charges should not be this difficult. If they are putting up this many road blocks for me, what are they doing with the less informed?"

It took several months but the inquiry was removed by XXXX after great effort on my part. I would like to know what person information does a financial intuition needs to provide a credit report agency before the XXXX will send out a full credit report on an individual back to the requesting company? Can an inquiry be moved from the hard inquiry section to the soft section of a credit report for other reason than fraud?

183129,Credit card,"Barclay 's closed my wife and my credit card accounts after having a positive history of using the card, nearly never carrying a balance month to month, and having cards open for multiple years. 
At no time did we ever receive any negative feedback or notifications that Barclay had any issue with my 'history of account usage '. 
In fact, despite the 'history of account usage ' that Barclay refers to in the closing, Barclay increased the credit limit on my card and my wife 's card in the past year, encouraging what they must later have decided is a poor 'history of account usage '. They also upgraded our cards to XXXX XXXX elite during the same period of 'history of account usage ' that was present during closure. 

In fact, I started using my primary card, the Arrival, exactly in a fashion that was advertised. I started using this card originally for everyday spend as well as to buy XXXX XXXX Gift Cards through the Barclay RewardsBoost mall, which they advertised on their own website was a great way to earn extra rewards. 

It seems clear to me that Barclay is closing our accounts because it is not profitable to provide us with rewards under the current program that they advertise, even though on their website, even today, it still shows "" Earn XXXX miles for every {$1.00} you spend on all your purchases '' and Redeem for travel statement credits starting at XXXX miles for {$25.00} toward a qualifying travel purchase of {$25.00} or more made within the last 120 days ''. 

With my last statement ( XXXX ) I had redeemed XXXX points ( {$140.00} ) but still had XXXX points adjusted at the closing of my account. 

If returning my account to good standing is not practicable, a payment for the miles which would have been worth the sum unredeemed as well as the annual fee for the services I could not receive but had already paid for seems reasonable : XXXX XXXX XXXX = {$380.00}. The 10 % bonus would have added {$38.00} when used for travel redemptions, which I always have available since I travel for business. This totals {$420.00}. 

My wife 's card had XXXX miles, which would have been worth {$19.00} XXXX XXXX = {$21.00}. 

I also paid a {$95.00} annual fee on this card, and on my wife 's card, totaling {$190.00} in fees which I am now not able to fully utilize given the cards were canceled in the middle of the membership year. 

This means my monetary damages from these XXXX closed cards are {$420.00} XXXX lost redemption, self ) + {$21.00} XXXX lost redemption, wife ) + {$190.00} ( annual fees ) = {$640.00}.

19646,Credit card,"Four years ago I opened a secured credit card with XXXX, for the SPECIFIC PURPOSE of improving my credit score. 

Initially it had a credit limit of {$500.00} and was secured with a {$500.00} CD, also with XXXX. 

In practice I found that if I put a XXXX dollars on the card my 'credit utilization ' ratio became too high, hurting my credit score, so I called XXXX and increased the CD security to {$2500.00} so that in any given month my % of credit used would be low. 

XXXX was able to increase the limit on my secured credit-building card in a matter of minutes. They quickly transferred money from my checking account to the CD - very easy and smooth, but with no warning of what lay ahead ... 

After four years I called XXXX to see if my credit was good enough to 'graduate ' the secured card to an unsecured card ( which is the industry norm ) thereby releasing my {$2500.00}. I was told that XXXX does not graduate cards, but that I should apply for a new card, which I did successfully. 

Now, a CRITICAL factor in credit is the length of the history of credit. Because of financial difficulties in 2010 many of my older accounts were closed, so it is vitally important to building my credit that I keep open the accounts that I have to build history. 

XXXX helpfully provides a credit score along with key factors influencing it. It says : "" What 's Hurting : Lack of sufficient credit history. 
What It Means Your credit file does not contain enough information about your use of credit. A credit file with older accounts and/or more accounts reflects more experience with handling credit and can have a positive impact on your credit score. 
Recommendation : Maintaining open and active credit accounts in good standing can help improve your credit score. '' In other words, XXXX OWN advice is that it is critical that I keep OPEN the secured card they gave me to help build my credit. 

However, now that I have an unsecured card with a line of $ XXXX it would be poor financial management to keep {$2500.00} needlessly tied up earning near-XXXX interest to secure a line of credit I no longer need. 

Clearly I should keep the secured account open with a reduced limit - say {$200.00} - so that it remains functional and contributes to my credit history, but releases the money I had tied up securing it. 

I called XXXX today to reduce the credit limit on the secured card and they will not do it. I spent an hour speaking to a number of representatives and escalating the matter as far as possible. 

They are absolutely clear : 1 : I can not graduate the secured card to release the security deposit held in a CD 2 : I can not reduce the credit limit and reduce the amount in the CD. The CD can only be increased, or closed. 

3 : If I close the CD the secured card account will immediately close DAMAGING MY CREDIT IMMEDIATELY by reducing my credit history 4 : They can not or will not allow me to open a new smaller CD to secure the card thereby allowing the {$2500.00} CD to be closed. 

Trying to be helpful I even asked if they would change the terms of the secured card to, say 0 % interest and 0 % minimum payment, which ( although it sounds absurd ) would have the effect of giving me back access to my {$2500.00} without penalty. No. 



THE BOTTOM LINE XXXX has effectively set up an extortion whereby the only way to get back the {$2500.00} I entrusted to them to help build my credit ... is to take a massive and permanent hit to my credit. 

This is very important. Many credit injustices - bad reporting, erroneous missed payments etc - can be fixed on appeal. 

But CLOSING a line of credit is a permanent and irreversible negative factor on an account - as even XXXX agree. 

The choice of hurting my credit or never having access to my {$2500.00} again ( other than on credit card terms ) would be completely unreasonable and unacceptable at any bank, and utterly against XXXX 's character."
243670,Mortgage,"Good Day : I am experiencing hardship and my mortgage is upside down. I solicited help through HOPE and was connected to XXXX. Who assisted me with my application with Citimortage for a loan modification. My application was sent XX/XX/2015. We were assigned an agent who we found to be very disrespectful of our time. Both the counselor from XXXX and myself were extremely disappointed and filed a complaint with a CitiMortgage supervisor. After our complaint were reviewed, I was assigned to another agent. 

I find that CitiMortage makes it difficult to speak with agents and deliberately makes the process daunting. Also, agents do not keep their appointments which makes the process very difficult. 
After calculating my expenses etc and going over my present hardship. XXXX agreed that I qualified for the Making Home Affordable Program. And suggested what my mortgage will be reduced too to assist me. 

Due to the fact that my XXXX counselor is on the XXXX XXXX and I am on XXXX. We scheduled specific times to speak with the representatives at CitiMortage, who made the process very difficult. 
When, I finally got my application in. The process became very confusing and I felt that either the process is discriminating, or CitiMortgage designs the process to frustrate its borrowers. 
I received a document form Citimortage on XXXX XXXX. Stating that I will receive information concerning my Making Home Affordable Modification Program, Payment Trial Payment Plan. The letter stated that once I met the terms of XXXX XXXX. My loan XXXX be permanently modified. 
After this letter I continued to received other notices that did not make sense. 

I called my agent at XXXX, she explained that the letter usually proceed with your offer. 
Weeks went by and I continued to receive baffling notices. I took time off for my work to call CitiMortgage and no one can confirm that I had received this letter. But they continued to asked me to send more information. 
When I finally spoke to my representative, XXXX XXXX, she finally stated that I should not have received the letter. 
At this point I was exhausted with the process and so was my agent at XXXX who was assisting me. 
However, after speaking to XXXX XXXX, I continued to received notice upon notice from CitiMorgage stating that I have been assigned to a new representative to assist me .... 
Frankly, I have never been so confused about a process and I question a big company like CitiMortgage motives. Once again I am not sure what to think of CitiMortage 's process. 
Please assist me in keep my home and providing me with an affordable mortgage. I am a good customer. 
Thank you XXXX XXXX XXXX"

I attached Cover letter, Child Support delinquent account and Head head from child support asking to remove Delinquency off my credit report and I owe {$0.00}."
249663,Consumer Loan,"This complaint is to accompany my previous complaint regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX here in Wi. In addition to the loan packing and material misrepresentations made during the transaction, I want to make it clear that when I gave my financial information I thought I would have opportunity to do my own application for the auto loan so I could read the terms. 
Everything was printed up, filled out and decided before I ever entered the finance office. 
I DID object to the ancillary products but was told the warranty and gap insurance were required by the lender. POINT BLANK. This is evidenced by the fact that I called the next day to discuss cancellation with the dealership. Also, I have a witness to the conversation with the GM at which time he said he was so "" sorry '' that the business manager told me I had to have the products to get a loan. That contract should have been re written immediately. XXXX XXXX ( GM ) clearly encourages employees to commit fraud. In addition, the salesman, the GM, the "" closer '' ( I do not know his name ) and the business manager all told me they would refinance me after a few on time payments because I balked at the interest rate of 22 % ( which was actually 22.9 % ). While my credit is poor, it 's not like I was in the XXXX. Between the XXXX bureaus the lowest was XXXX and highest was XXXX. I now know that refinancing will only cost more. My loan is based on the rule of XXXX which is outlawed in many states. Apparently the loan was funded immediately which prevented me from payment amounts I had previously calculated, under XXXX per month. It is this type of predatory conduct that put me in this position in the first place. I was XXXX of the first in 2007 to lose everything due to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, etc. My issues with Credit Acceptance Corporation are the following : 1. Ignoring their duty to investigate dealerships they work with 2. They refuse to give me a recalculation after refunds 3. Possible pre payment penalties for products I objected to 3. Added fees for cancellation 4. I was sent a payment booklet with payment and terms as if nothing was cancelled. I was told "" It aint gon na happen '' to get an honest recalculation. The rule of XXXX is so confusing even accountants rarely understand it. 
Everybody lied about everything said and document execution was very shady to say the least. There are only e signatures except for two things ... and those two things were hidden by a hand. I was under extreme duress because the dealership asked to see my check from my insurance company ( XXXX ) and REFUSED to give it back. I did absolutely ask the right questions, I am not an XXXX! My check was misapproppriated and "" processed '' before the papers were even signed. This is what I was told and the lender does NOT CARE. It is my opinion that the dealership and this lender are making back door deals that harm consumers. This will put me right back into bankruptcy. I also want to know if there is a disabling device in my vehicle, the lender will not disclose this. How do they get away with this? If this is not conspiracy to defraud I do n't know what is. Please for the love of XXXX investigate Credit Acceptance Corp and XXXX XXXX XXXX. By the way, XXXX XXXX is on a feeding frenzy for people with poor credit according to all the ads and flyers. I found them on a XXXX link and their website calls for people that can qualify with NO CREDIT CHECK. I put myself into the computation ( after my car purchase ) and it seems with no credit check I should have under 12 % interest rate. Hmmm. The salesman told me they had "" special loans '' for people on XXXX. That is why I went there in the first place. This is crime after crime and somebody needs to move on it. My loan is bad enough, however, if it is sold into securities who will care that nearly XXXX was refunded to the lender??? My payment book is the same."

207602,Debt collection,On XXXX XXXX 2014 I was in the emergency room at XXXX XXXX XXXX Co. I have double insurance coverage and both companies were billed the total amount instead of billing the secondary only what the primary did not pay. The secondary assumed there was no other insurance and issued an Explanation of Benefits stating {$370.00} was owed. The primary insurance payed all but he {$250.00} deductible and I payed that. The hospital had then been payed the total contracted amount. We contacted XXXX four times and they would not re-bill the Secondary insurance company insisting the problem was the insurance companies fault. We solved the problem by providing information to the secondary insurance company and they reissued a new XXXX stating nothing was owed because the entire contracted amount was payed by the primary insurance company and the deductible was covered by me. XXXX turned the matter over to XXXX XXXX debt collectors. When we explained to XXXX Advantage and sent them the written Explanation of benefits they dropped the matter. XXXX then turned us into another debt collector called Global Receivables. Global receivables does not want to receive any information from us concerning the matter. I told them I would send them XXXX XXXX 's from the insurance companies and they said no. We have been harassed for over a year with threatening phone calls and letters.
43692,Consumer Loan,"Last week I applied for a used car loan at my financial institution, USAA. I asked for a loan up to {$15000.00} but also told the loan processer at USAA that I hoped I would need a loan for less than $ 15K after we finished negotiations on the car. I was quoted a rate of 2.75 % for this loan. 
After concluding negotiations with the owner of the vehicle for the sale at {$13000.00}, I gave the owner my personal check for {$1000.00}, so the remainder needed for a loan was {$12000.00}. I called USAA to execute the loan, but was told that for any amount less than $ 15K, the interest rate would be higher than 2.75 %. Because of the higher rate, I complained and spoke to several different people in USAA 's loan department, resulting in rates quoted from 4.75 % down to 3.2439 %. They still refused to give me the rate originally quoted of 2.75 %, even though I have a screen printed from their website showing the 2.75 % rate for my loan. They claimed that if I would take the $ 15K ( or higher amount ) loan, I could still get the 2.75 % rate, but for any lesser amount, the rate would be higher. This makes no sense at all, since their risk for a smaller loan amount is less than with the larger loan amount. 

This is nothing more than a classic "" bait-and-switch '' tactic. If this was a disreputable loan shark, I might understand their tactic, but for USAA, I did n't expect such dishonorable and dishonest behavior. They should be prosecuted for their "" bait-and-switch '' tactic to the fullest extent of the law."

295385,Bank account or service,"We have our mortgage and checking account with Chase. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, we mailed a mortgage payment to Chase bank, along with a Chase provided payment coupon with our mortgage information pre-printed on it. On Friday, XXXX XXXX, we realized that the check had not cleared. We called Chase to make a mortgage payment over the phone so that our mortgage payment would not be late, and to put a stop payment on the original check. We did not feel that we should have to pay the stop payment fee since Chase had not cashed our check in a timely fashion. After initially making the excuse that the US Postal service could have lost our check, the customer service rep agreed to waive the stop payment fee. After verifying twice that the transaction was complete, we ended the call. On Sunday, XXXX XXXX, we realized that we only had {$49.00} in our bank account. Both the check that we mailed and the phone payment had gone through. We called the bank. After approximately 45 minutes on the phone, we managed to kind of straighten out the situation. We were told that it could take up to 12 hours for our money to credit back to our account. We had to further argue that since we had planned to do our weekly grocery shopping that day ( Sunday ) and fill pharmacy prescriptions, that we did not want to be responsible for any overdraft fees. We were also told during the conversation on XX/XX/XXXX that the stop payment fee had been waived on XX/XX/XXXX, but the bank never actually stopped payment on the check, which makes no sense but does prove that Chase was negligent in it 's fiduciary duty, since our money was not available to us. It is apparent that the bank both had our check and failed to cash it in a timely manner. We acted responsibly to make sure our mortgage was paid on time, only to have our bank account nearly drained, and then had to fight to not pay any fees when Chase was clearly at fault. This scenario was n't just inconvenient, but just another example of Chase bank 's bullying and extortion of the American people. We were previously dual tracked when attempting to modify our loan with Chase and were only able to keep our home because we filed for personal bankruptcy, which was both demoralizing and embarrassing. We continue to be victimized and pushed around."

753822,Credit card,"This is actually a follow-up to a CFPB claim with reference number XXXX. I was n't able to respond to it online, so I 'm filing a separate claim. Please, read it in its entirety before sending me a template response, thank you. I 'll let you look up the specifics of the original complaint, so let me address your response letter I just got in the mail. 
In the letter you are telling me that my XXXX points were not available at the time of conversion. 
This is incorrect because they were available for redemption or mileage transfers, so how could they be simultaneously pending? I 'm attaching a screenshot that shows XXXX were EARNED. That 's similar to saying that a person is still pregnant after giving birth. 
The bonus is listed in "" earned '' category, nothing pending about that. When I logged in prior to this debacle, my account showed XXXX points and underneath of it it clearly said "" available. '' You ca n't have points available and pending at the same time. It 's a contradiction. 
You are also telling me that the CSR was referring to my earned points, not the bonus, since unbeknownst to me and I 'm guessing him too, the bonus points were under review. This is ridiculous on so many levels. Surely, any well-trained CSR would mention to the customer a "" small '' issue of losing XXXX points if they go ahead with the conversion. Are you telling me it 's a conspiracy and you wanted me to lose the points? 
By that logic, the clawback should be in "" pending '' status as well, and you should let me upgrade back to Platinum product. It 's only fair. 
I will be more than happy if you convert XXXX card back to Platinum and charge me the annual fee again as long as my XXXX points get reinstated. If you fail to do so, I plan on filing a small claim to seek damages. Be aware, I plan on demanding compensation for my time as well. I 'm also thinking about pursuing arbitration. Make no mistake about it, I 'm not planning to let this issue drop. I 'm hoping you can reinstate the points, so we can move on from this ordeal. It 's up to you now to resolve this issue without going to court. Thank you for your cooperation."

I had {$8.00} in my account on XXXX XXXX and went to spend a little over {$5.00}. Because he did not know there was a {$3.00} charge for checking my account balance, I was overdrawn. It has taken me awhile to figure out what was going on. I would appreciate your interceding with this large financial intermediary and remedying their shadowy, venal behavior. This is another example of a large for profit entity leaching off consumers to, drip by drip, swell their profits. We can not afford to subsidize the bank."

I offered to pay {$50.00} to settle with them, and they refused."
663893,Mortgage,"In XXXX XXXX I called Wells Fargo Home Mortgage ( WFHM ) and spoke to a customer service rep concerning my mortgage payment for that month. Since i was still in the "" grace period '' the customer rep offered a repayment program called a Temporary Forebearance Agreement. Under this program the XXXX XXXX mortgage payment would be deferred and repaid in XXXX equal installments over the next 3 months. The repayments would be in addition to the normal mortgage payments due at that time. 

I asked the customer rep it entering this program would reflect negatively on my personal credit report. Her response was that if i complied with the terms of the agreement then nothing negative would be reported to any of the reporting agencies,. However, in order to participate in the program i had to agree to allow WFHM to debit my account when the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX mortgage payments came due plus add XXXX of the deferred amount to the total. In addition, since the agreement was made during the XXXX XXXX grace period I would not be considered delinquent. 

I agreed to the terms as i understood them at that time and provided the customer rep with my account number and I did not make the XXXX XXXX mortgage payment. The program was completed in XXXX XXXX and the obligation completed. 

Two problems have arisen for me as a result of this agreement with WFHM : 1 ) The missed payment somehow grew into XXXX delinquent payments 2 ) The aforementioned alleged delinquent payments were reported to XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX consequently negatively effecting my credit and credit score In reviewing the mortgage summaries for these periods and item labeled "" Applied Funds '' appears. It seems that when WFHM debited my account they did not know where to apply the funds. The complete payments might have been placed in an escrow account and neither the regular nor deferred payments were properly credited even though paid per the agreement and on time. Since WFHM presumably designed the program and offered the product to customers it seems reasonable to think that they would have known how to manage and operate it. Once the funds were debited I had no control over how the funds were treated.Of course the customer suffers from the banks inefficiencies. 

Lastly, i did not receive a copy of the Temporary Forebearance Agreement until XXXX XXXX. As a result fully understanding the terms was different than what was explained by the customer rep. WFHM claimed that my conversation with the customer rep was recorded but when pressed to produce it they could not. So it becomes a case of my word against theirs."

I immediately contacted them and asked them why it went up so much and they said this was the original amount. I tried to pull up the original info I signed and it wa sno longer available. I asked them how could they possibly charge me almost {$3000.00} for a {$1700.00} loan?? The interest rate is almost 591.00 % which is ridiculous! But with loop holes being in the Ohio consumer loan process, they get away with predatory lending which this is. They offer a loan amount to those who have bad credit and then charge a high payback along with ridiculous interest rates and fees.

I was able to make partial payments to avoid further damage, but Nationstar rejected my payments and removed the online payment feature online to prevent me from making any payments. I called NationStar to get a reinstatement quote and was verbally given an amount of {$6700.00} to reinstate my loan. I gathered the funds and Nationstar gave me a account to wire only. I went to my bank to process the wire transfer and the bank manager could not verify the account number that was given to me and the name on the account that was given to me and the account did not belong to Nationstar Mortage. I refused to wire the funds to that account and called Nationstar and asked them to draft the funds from my personal bank account. The payment was processed XX/XX/2016 and my loan was reinstated and current. XX/XX/2016 mortgage was due and I made a partial payment of XXXX and learned Nationstar had created bogus fees and applied my partial payment toward these fees. I then received a statement on XX/XX/2016 stating I owed over 2 months worth of fees. I asked Nationstar what these fees were and was not given any answer. I also asked Nationstar to please apply my partial payment and apply towards my XX/XX/2016 mortgage and also to reverse fees. Nationstar has not complied. I believe I have been scammed due to unethical business practices and Nationstar is foreclosing again based upon ficticious fees and misapplication of funds."
181204,Student loan,"AES refuses to assist me with a reasonable payment option for my ALPLN loan. I am not able to make the current amount ( it is an entire paycheck at my current wage ) and they simply state there is no other options. If the current situation continues it will cause great undue hardship upon me and my family. Take note that I have made timely payments since for years now. I sincerely asked that they provide me with any option and they stated I had used all my options. They offered to lower another loan amount ( only temporary of course and they make it sound like this option is there to help me of course its going to put a lot more money in their pocket ) but of course that would lead to paying a greater amount of interest on that loan leaving me worse off than I am currently. I want to repay my debt however they make it impossible, the interest rates are completely unaffordable. I soon as I feel like Im on top of this situation they pull the rug out! I have paid more than enough interest for them to tell me there is not an option is completely cutthroat on their part. If they truly cared about the consumer they would take into consideration the individuals income or help them by finding an interest rate that is affordable and profitable for the company. AES is taking away the future of the students it supposedly served to help obtain a solid financial future. The university I attended is XXXX University XXXX."

646220,Debt collection,I am in distraught due to a collection debt XXXX XXXX XXXX had reported to the collection agency. This debt is now significantly damaging my credit score. I do not owe this amount nor the account belong to me. I recently started receiving mailing statements from this enhanced recovery company to collect that debt. I am outraged. I complained to the XXXX and also attempted twice to dispute these actions for the debt owed to the credit agencies. A lady by XXXX XXXX from the XXXX headquarters had harassed me with phone call and responded with a letter in regards to my complaint with the XXXX. She has a record of a XXXX XXXX and not myself. This is really embarrassing and completely inaccurate. I even attempted to reach out this person and see if there was a way to resolve this debt however I shouldnt have to because it does n't belong to me. Please help me with these inaccuracies and unlawful approaches this company has directed towards me.
63778,Debt collection,"I 've been looking into my credit reports daily. Mainly because I 'm tired of being contacted by different companies regarding the same medical bills when I ha2d insurance coverage.They have noverlapping accounts on my credit reports. For example XXXX XXXX ( orginal creditor ) sold my account to XXXX XXXX, so why are they both contacting me. And AMCOL SYSTEMS INC is continuing to attempt collections on dates of service that matches PROFESSIONAL XXXX along with identical monetary claims. I 've been told by AMCOL SYSTEMS INC If not paid asap that I would go to jail. They are claiming ammounts of upwards of {$8400.00} for an XXXX visit. They 're are collection 's for services rendered when I was not within XXXX miles of the area. I 've had my state tax returns garnished, then there it is listed on an open account.

360047,Credit card,Sears Credit Department/Citi Bank adversely closed my credit card account while I 'm a victim of identity theft and then hung up in my face while I was trying to explain that the credit report that they have pulled may not be accurate. I contacted Sears Credit Dept and explained that I have had all my credit reports frozen because I 've been a victim of identity theft. That in the past I 've had trouble with the viewing of my credit report because it has been frozen by all the credit bureaus. I asked about the credit report pulled and I wanted to make sure that it was an updated report because not an old report because I had my reports frozen. I asked to speak with a supervisor because the credit analyst explained that there was nothing that I could do even though I was a victim of identity theft. I spoke with the the supervisor where the supervisor explained that they do n't pull my credit report but a summary or snapshot of my credit report through XXXX. I then explained that when you pull a credit report it explains that Ive been a victim identity theft instead of just a summary of my credit which may or may not be accurate. She said its great that you 've had your credit reports frozen but you need to take the derogatory comments on your credit report with XXXX. I explained that I had never paid Sears late in spite of identity theft. As I explained to the supervisor that my account should n't be closed when I 've had my credit report frozen as a victim of identity theft I was then hung up on by the supervisor. The supervisor and the credit analyst had my telephone number in the event that the call was disconnected and to call me back if the wait was too long. However neither attempted to call me back. Sears/ Citi Bank does not have procedures in place when their customers are victims of identity theft and that they make adverse decisions regardless of whether their summary snap shot review is accurate or not. Had they pulled my credit report they would 've been aware that I was a victim of identity theft. I would like my credit card account re-opened. I 'm a person and unforeseen things happened but I 've never paid Sears/ Citi Bank late. I 've got a great pay history and have worked hard to try and keep that but does not matter to Sears/Citi Bank. Closing my account continues to hurt my credit.

Fifth Third told me that because the mortgage was paid off they would not pay the tax bill and I should pay it directly. I did pay it myself, but it turned out that so did Fifth Third, and they deducted that amount from my escrow pay-off. However, when I called the XXXX County tax bureau in XXXX, they said they only received one payment -- mine. They told me if they had received 2 payments they would not have processed the second payment. They would have simply sent it back. So, even though Fifth Third said they paid it, that payment has never been processed. I have no idea if their check was ever issued or is lost or whatever. But the tax authorities only received my personal payment. I have contacted Fifth Third numerous times, and all I get is the runaround. First they told me they need more time to investigate the matter, to make sure the payment was not completed. Then they told me they need more time to process the refund. Then last time, on or around XX/XX/2016, they told me the check was in the mail. This turned out not to be true, since no check has arrived. It is now 2 and 1/2 months, with no resolution in sight. Fifth Third is being totally uncooperative and unhelpful. They should be made to return my money. Here is a copy from the Fifth Third Website indicating they deducted the payment from my escrow account on XX/XX/2016.

Now after we provided all the documents, buyers offer and appraisal requested by nationstar. Nationstar is refusing to work with the buyer that offer the max amount requested by Nationstar Mortgage. 

I called Nationstar Mortgage and spoke to XXXX XXXX and she told my realtor because one of her family members is interested on my home. XXXX will not review the offer of the buyer who has been waiting on the short sale approval for over 6 months. But instead she will forward my property to a website where called XXXX OR XXXX where they will conduct an auction. 

I feel this is not a fair review, the buyer who has been waiting for his offer to be accepted, which the buyer agreed to pay for the maximum amount requested by Nationstar Mortgage. it seems like they are discriminating the buyers.

I encounter this same problem back in XXXX of this same year, and when I went into a branch a banker waive the fee once I show him the information I have received as far as account balance. The representative informed me to go into branch for farther assistance. I went into a branch located in the downtown area of XXXX, Il.

She proceed to tried to sell me a line of credit and than a secure credit card, which I found to be distasteful at the least. I think it was unfair not to waive the XXXX overdraft fees and especially after the branch manager herself stated it was a valid discrepancy but stated if they refuse to do it over the phone I am not doing it neither because you had XXXX in overdraft fees waive within a year which I know to be untrue. I had to file a fraudulent claim in XX/XX/XXXX and still have the documentation to support it."
282117,Mortgage,"My mortgage processor informed me XXXX hours out that we 'd have to postpone closing ( originally scheduled for XXXX XXXX ) for an undetermined period of time.

The original appraisal was contingent upon septic system repairs being completed ... these repairs had been completed XXXX weeks prior to closing, but my mortgage processor waited until XXXX weeks before the closing date to tell me that this follow-up would be needed and they 'd be requesting it then. All along in this process, I 've been told we 're ahead of schedule.

They made statements that credit cards do n't always report to credit reports or that it might not show up on a credit report since it had been 8 years. They were adamant that there was no possible fraud involved on the account. They were each extremely pushy and would not listen to what we said, would not reveal their client ( seeing as this bank was bought out by XXXX XXXX and no longer exists ), said only that they were a collection agency and insisted that my wife had opened this account. She has never been contacted by XXXX XXXX. This is the first time we have heard anything on this "" debt ''.

I see what they have done to my brother and now it has affected me personally. Due to their need to get these zombie homes back into the mainstream and sell them yet again, they need to stop me from providing further damaging information on them. 
PLEASE make sure all information you have is correct as I am also willing to provide the information that they were allowed to use false information. 
I will be following up with hard copies that I printed in advance as I thought something like this would happen.

Federal law protects the privacy of most personally identifiable information reported. However, credit bureaus actively search public records for any judgements or tax liens. 

A Tax Lien filing is public information. Again, state or federal recorders do not report anything to the various credit bureaus, nor do they verify that the information reported is accurate. XXXX has found information on previously stated Tax Lien 's through third party research. 

I had asked that Transunion please validate this information and provide me with copies of any documentation associated with this account bearing my signature. In the absence of any such documentation bearing my signature, I formally request that this information be immediately deleted from the credit file you maintain under my Social Security number. 

I also had received a letter from a government agency, based on my inquiry, stating that they do not report this information directly to the credit bureaus."

When I talked to this so-called XXXX, she provided me with another number to call ( XXXX ) and a case number XXXX. I asked XXXX for her number and she said she could not disclose it since they get death threats all the time and their number is always blocked. Our phones at work have caller ID, and I pointed out to her that the number showed as ( XXXX ) and she was amazed that it was not blocked and confirmed that was her number. They continued to harass me at my place of work, calling the receptionist and demanded to speak to my supervisor. I then tried calling them back, most of the time they would not respond. When they did respond I told them to stop calling me at work. The last time they answered I was threatened and told they would be sending a wage garnishment to my payroll department at work."
712550,Debt collection,"I financed an Iphone 5 with XXXX back in XXXX and I had full coverage insurance. The phone was stolen around the end of XXXX and i put in for an insurance claim. XXXX said I needed to file a police report and give them a copy of it. I faxed it in, I mailed it in and then I faxed it again. The first two times I called to see if they got it they said they did n't. The third time I was told they did have it. In about XXXX or XXXX of XXXX the investigator sent me a letter saying that they found the phone. I asked him if it had been wiped clean, as I had lots of pictures of my daughter and my dad who had passed away on that phone. I really just wanted the pictures and did n't think I had really any right to the phone since the insurance covered it. So I called XXXX and told them about the letter and that the phone was at the XXXX Police Dept and did they want the phone back. They told me no, and then they proceed to tell me that they did n't get the report in time to do the insurance claim. It takes 2-3 weeks min to get the report and i sent it a few times to them. The problem is back then XXXX 's customer service was horrible, no one knew what they were doing and I got conflicting infomation about everything whether is be a billing inquiry, or complaints about service. I traded in my old Iphone and they told me in the store I was to get {$200.00} credit toward the new one, and when it never showed up on my statement- I finaced the phone for like {$20.00} a month, customer service told me that I never traded in a phone and there is no record of it. Finally after hours on the phone and going back and forth to the store, talking to managers, they finally gave me {$50.00} for the phone and that their employee made a mistake by telling me i was to get {$200.00}. So now they have sent this to collections. I dispute it with the credit bureaus and it gets removed from my credit file, then the collection company sells the debt to another collection agency and the process starts over again. This last time my dispute was finalized XX/XX/XXXX and this new account was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. I never know when it will show back up. And unfortunately for me, I am a single mom with XXXX kids, im on public assistance, I work but only make about {$1200.00} a month take home. My car just broke down and it going to cost more to fix it than it worth. I wanted to go get a {$5000.00} loan for a car and was planning on paying most of it off when I got my taxes. Other wise on the train and bus it takes me almost 4 hours to get the kids to school and daycare, then I go to work for a few hours and it takes another 4 hours to get home. I need a car other wise my kids do n't get homework done in time and when we arent home til XXXX its time for bed, they have to get bathed and eat and they will be going to bed too late and not getting the proper sleep, and spending all day on a bus and train is not cool. And of course that day the collection shows back up again. There must be something I can do, the credit bureaus said it is legal for them to do this and they can continue to do it til they can not report it. I am afraid to call them because I do n't want the statue of limitations to start over, I do n't trust them. Is there any recourse I can take to resolve this once and for all. If an emergency happens and I dont make much money, I need my credit to fall back on, and was finally getting good again. Other wise my kids wo n't eat or rent wo n't get paid and we will be back on the street again. It happened before when my credit was bad. They should not be able to do this especially if it has been disputed and removed after I furnished the proof of everything, what should I do??

81135,Credit reporting,"It is my consumer right under the FCRA to dispute anything on my credit report I feel is inaccurate. This is where the bankruptcy and XXXX has come to play. I understand the law and not arguing with a true verified Bankruptcy that you have placed on someones account. In this case this is not the case. This Bankruptcy/XXXX has been disputed because as stated it is my right to dispute anything inaccurate showing on my credit report. You have FAILED to still explain how you have verified this information. Who did you verfify this information from? WHERE ARE THE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO YOU SHOWING THAT THIS INACCURATE REPORTING HAS BEEN VERIFIED. I also contacted the address below in refrence to this BK XXXX you are reporting and they advise that they have not verified this inaccuracy with anyone! So. Where and HOW did you verify this information?? I also will be going up Tto this is office to get something in writing on there letter head explaining what they advise to me that they DID NOT VERIFY ANYTHING WITH EXPERIAN. SO I ASK AGAIN HOW DID YOU VERIFY AND WITH WHOM SO I CAN REACH OUT TO THEM? 

XXXX Law Dictionary, XXXX Edition, 2009, defines "" Verify '' as, 1 ) "" To prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to authenticate. '' 2 ) "" To confirm or substantiate by oath or affidavit ; to swear to the truth of. '' and "" Verification '' as, "" Confirmation of correctness, truth or authenticity, by affidavit, oath, or deposition. Affidavit of truth of a matter stated and object of verification is to assure good faith in averments or statements of a party. '' What this means is that your company must be willing and able to produce a document in your files that proves the account in dispute belongs to me and the information being reported is accurate and you must be able to do this in a court of law if I file a lawsuit against you. Someone in your company must authenticate the documents in your files that were used to verify the disputed account and to do this they must have 1st hand knowledge of the alleged account and all that has ever transpired for the alleged account ( s ), under oath and under the penalty of perjury. As I am sure that you are well aware, current Federal case law states that, Consumer Reporting Agencies bear grave responsibilities to ensure the accuracy of the accounts they report on and their responsibility must consist of something more than merely parroting information received from other sources. The Courts have also ordered that a "" Reinvestigation '' that merely shifts the burden back to the consumer and the credit grantor can not fulfill the obligations imposed by 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ). 

You have basically ignored my request to provided me with the documents that you have in your files that you used to verify this bankruptcy/XXXX ACCOUNTS which means that you have NOT verified or you can not verify under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA - you are required to "" ... promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. '' The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me for "" negligent noncompliance '' ( Section 617 ) if you fail to comply with this Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA. I demand the following accounts be verified or deleted immediately."

386097,Credit card,"WellsFargo gouges their consumers by playing fast and loose with the dates when they close credit card billing cycles : they close the billing cycle earlier than they are supposed to thus not applying payments made on the last day of the business cycle towards the outstanding balance and therefore calculating higher monthly payments than they would otherwise have calculated had they closed the billing cycle on the day when they were supposed to. This gouges the customer twice : first, it calculates the minimum payment on the basis of a higher balance ; second, because they 've already calculated a minimum amount due the following month before the current billing cycle actually closed, they take the payment made on the last day of the billing cycle and apply it first towards paying this higher, fraudulently calculated payment, and only apply the remainder towards the balance. In addition, they never actually communicate when the billing cycles end to customers until after the fact. I had to call them and ask them to give me the last dates when I could make payments on my account. According to those days I should still have been able to apply a payment I made today towards the balance on my account but lo and behold, when I went online to make that payment ( I had planned to pay down {$1800.00} ) they had already calculated my minimum payment due next month. I called them about it again and now they are telling me that the business cycle ends not at midnight on the dates they had given me before but at XXXX am the day before. ( What?!?!?!? ).

I recently discovered in checking my credit information on XXXX XXXX that this account was added to my credit information recently. It was not on my credit report originally or at any time prior to now. When I called State Farm because I suspected fraud, I was advised my name was on the account owned by my employer. State Farm sent a letter requiring both of our signatures to remove me as a card holder. I have now discovered this request was denied.

This transfer was to take 2-3 business days. I confirmed that this request was put in when I called back on XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX, another account supervisor. She assured me that the funds would be in my payment account no later than XXXX XXXX. It has now been four business days ( XXXX XXXX ) since the request has been submitted. The funds have not been transferred and the payment has yet to be reversed off the credit card account. My financial institution clears all incoming ACHs around XXXX EST. When I called Capital One on the morning of XXXX XXXX they stated that there are no account supervisors to further discuss the delay in these funds being transferred. Once again I confirmed the timeframe of 2-3 business days and she said I was correct. XXXX XXXX is a federal holiday and then the weekend follows, which will further delay these funds being transferred since there are very limited kinds of ACHs that may or may not clear on these days. I was told to call back in a few hours when an account supervisor will be available to assist me since the regular customer service representatives have no further information to pass along. I received the normal apology and empathy from the representative that all customer service reps are trained to display, but received no further information than the payment was still applied to the account."

Only Trinity and Hope Associates was mentioned. I was advised by XXXX XXXX to wait until charge was posted before I disputed it. This is what I did, submitting to them all paperwork on this matter. Finding bill from hospital in the amount of {$610.00} I was willing to dispute only the excess charge over that amount however after calling insurance and learning there was never a request for payment from hospital in my name or the billing account listed I decide to dispute the entire {$1500.00} that was charged.

609932,Debt collection,"Based on the detailed facts below and attached documents, I am concerned that I am a victim of some type of attempted financial fraud by a collection agency or an alleged collection agency. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I began receiving several alerts at the same time, from my credit monitoring service related to various companies who claim that I owe them a debt. The majority of what I could glean from the credit alert was that the alleged debts were related to medical collections although a few of the alerts did not state any circumstances regarding the debts. In the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, they appear to be the same company using the tactic of reporting the same collection to various credit reporting agencies but using different names in an attempt to damage my credit and coerce me to pay for a debt that I do not owe. I have never received bills from the said companies and I have no idea what the nature of the collection may be. 
In the case of ATG CREDIT LLC, the amounts owed are different than proposed by XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX but I am concerned that this company is somehow related to or acting on behalf of XXXX and XXXX since their collection attempt is also related to alleged "" medical '' debts and it was reported to the credit unions on the same day that XXXX and XXXX placed the negative charge against my credit. In addition, if they are related companies coercing me to pay a debt not owed while holding my credit worthiness status hostage, the act of reporting the same debt to different agencies, changing account numbers, changing their corporation names and addresses is manipulative and is an exaggeration to deliberately coerce me to send money for a debt not owed. 
Please advise me whether or not this practice is illegal in the State of Florida or under Federal Law. I can not believe that we have a judicial system that allows scandalous collection agencies to use bully tactics to siphon money from unwitting citizens and furthermore, are not required to provide me with official notice of the details of the debt owed including the establishment where the debt was incurred, the dates and any proof of their allegations. I have not been provided any services by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or ATG CREDIT! 
NOTE : On XXXX/XXXX/2015, I called ATG CREDIT using the number ( XXXX ) XXXX to inquire about the debt at XXXX. I spoke to a woman who escalated the conversation to the level of a bully and did not provide details regarding the nature of the debt, the provider, the date, etc. A few minutes later, I called back to try and get another service representative and I did. I explained why I was calling and he politely told me to hold. The same bully got back on the line with a harassing tone and hung up when I asked her permission to record our conversation. She said she was recording me so I only thought it was fair to represent myself for future issues. To date, I have yet to receive the requested formal correspondence regarding the details of what the company claims I owe to them. The collection is still on my file. How is all of this legal???"

468098,Mortgage,"Pursuant to a closing on XXXX/XXXX/16, mortgage lender, PennyMac was paid in full via an electronic funds draft from XXXX XXXX on the holiday XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$75000.00}. ( Verified received and posted by PennyMac on XXXX/XXXX/16. ) This is the payoff amount they furnished as being good through XXXX/XXXX/16. Yet, on XX/XX/XXXX, after being paid in full, PennyMac withdrew {$810.00} from my checking account. ( Statement enclosed. ) That same day, I spoke with PennyMac 's CSR, XXXX, regarding their error. She said she saw the duplicate payment for XX/XX/XXXX. She told me that she submitted a request for my refund to be "" expedited '' per my request due to their unexpected withdrawl costing me NSF fees in my checking account. While waiting for my refund, the next week, I received a notice from PennyMac also dated XX/XX/XXXX, advising me that "" any remaining funds in your escrow account will be mailed to you within 20 days from the date your loan payoff. '' As of XX/XX/XXXX, I had never received my "" expedited '' refund of the duplicate mortgage payment nor the proceeds from the escrow account. I called again. This time, I spoke with a CSR named XXXX. She told me that the actual amount of the mortgage & {$1500.00} escrow refund that I would be receiving was {$2000.00}. I learned that no refund of the duplicate XX/XX/XXXX payment had ever been sent, "" expedited '' or otherwise. I was told that included in this refund was only {$540.00} of the {$810.00} overpayment. PennyMac was keeping {$270.00}. The reason I was given, was that FHA allegedly requires a full month of interest be paid on all loans even if the loan was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX or first few days of a month - no pro-rated interest. She said they would be paying FHA this amount in XX/XX/XXXX for the paid off loan. I have no way of knowing if this is true or not. I have never seen that disclosed in writing, such as the payoff amount was. Is this true? Should n't they have been required to disclose that to me? Anyway, she said the check was in the mail. I still had n't received my refund by XXXX/XXXX/16, so I called again. This time, I spoke to CSR, XXXX. He said, that the check had been mailed out on XXXX/XXXX/16. Neither of us could understand why it would be taking so long. He said, he was emailing his supervisor to put a stop payment on the missing check. He said, they would send a replacement check via XXXX & that he would call me back with the tracking number. By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had n't received a callback from XXXX or anyone with the tracking number. I called & reached CSR, XXXX ( sp? ) who contacted XXXX. Later on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX called, sounding somewhat irritated. He said he had n't called me back because he had n't yet received a tracking number back to give me. This was only supposed to take a few days. No more than a week, I was told initially. He said, they did stop the first check on XX/XX/XXXX. That check has still never turned up in the mail. As of today, XXXX XXXX, I am still waiting for XXXX to call me back with that XXXX tracking number. Since nothing I have been told by anyone at this company for over the last month has been true, I am starting to think I have been deliberately lied to & they have no intention of refunding me my money! I am retired and I do not have money where they can just keep my money like this for as long as they need, returning it if/or when they decide to. This whole thing has been wrong. Surely, there are government regulations governing timely disbursement of monies owed consumers by mortgage companies. I really need your agencies ' assistance in getting my refund. Thank You."
686326,Debt collection,"I started receiving numerous phone calls in XXXX. They left voicemails asking me to call them back but never said why they were calling. When I called them back they told me my payment was missed. I informed them that I had paid my most recent payment. The calls still continued. It got to the point where I started saving their phone numbers into my phone as Spam. Again, they never said WHY they were calling when the left messages. I spoke with a handful of different people and had 4 different names and numbers saved as spam in my phone. In XXXX I received a call again and returned it so that I could put a stop to their phone calls. At this point the representative pulled up my history and explained there was a missed payment from way back in XXXX. ( None of the previous reps had stated this ). At this point I secured a payment date and paid on time. I still received another phone call the very next day from the same rep. Again he left a message without the reason for his call. This is ridiculous, time consuming and quite a headache and I do not understand why they call so much, were uneducated as to why they were calling me, and nobody could explain the back-dated late payment."
254275,Credit reporting,"I have filed numerous complaints and disputes with Transunion, and as a monthly subscriber to their credit services, I have to say that I 'm appalled by their level of paying-customer service, much less attention to the needs of the consumer. Once they open an investigation, it essentially FREEZES the entire credit report during the dispute process, which takes approx. 30 days for each dispute. This means, that even though I have daily access to view updated credit reports, they information is static. 
On 10+ occasions during the past month, I have contacted them concerning an account to which I was listed as an "" authorized user ''. This account was supposed to be removed over XXXX days ago, but they have failed to remove it. This past occurrence, I was instructed on XXXX XXXX that I would need to dispute the information directly with the creditor and file a dispute with Transunion. I did just that, and now they are approximately 20+ days into that dispute and have not contacted the creditor once. I spent over 4 hours on the phone with several departments within the creditor, and they assured me that nobody from ANY credit agency has contacted them, much less Transunion. 
I 've attempted to upload files to their dispute process, but since my report/file is completely frozen, it is impossible to do so. I 've tried faxing in supporting documents to the number they provided, but the fax # has been busy for 10 straight days. I 've tried calling them to request an email address I can send supporting documents to, and they attempt to convince me that nobody in their company has an email address. 
To date, I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card ( XXXX the same place ) and have removed myself as an authorized user for the account. My wife is the only person financially responsible for this account, and I have supporting documents to show this removal. I 've attempted to have this resolved quickly by Transunion, but they seem content to not do anything in terms of an actual investigation and are failing service expectations miserably."
425603,Credit card,"I wrote a letter in response and follow up to a phone call I had made to a representative of Pay Pal and was instructed to send Pay Pal a letter documenting a complaint that I felt borders predatory practices. 

"" On Monday the XXXX day of XXXX, I was asked by a property management company if I would sign up for a pay pal account to pay an invoice they had prepared for me. It did not appear to be that big of an inconvenience, and thought in doing so, I may use from time to time when vacationing via XXXX, to pay for stays seeing it is widely used throughout XXXX. After joining, I paid a small invoice and thought nothing more about until I received a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/2015, stating I had been denied credit. I know that I had not requested any credit cards with pay pal, or any other type of credit, I became alarmed that someone was using my information that I provided when joining pay pal and quickly called to cease any malicious action on my behalf that may be occurring. After speaking with the pay pal representative and her looking over the online correspondence, it appears, from her account that I entered the last XXXX of my social thinking that it was part of signing up for a pay pal and inadvertently requested credit on my behalf, which I most certainly was not aware of! She told me that this is a common mistake and to write this letter. With that said, I feel that the way in which the credit is presented appears to be consistent with the remainder of a pay pal account, and most definitely not a third party/bank ( XXXX XXXX Bank ) soliciting and extending credit. I believe it is predatory in nature and a reputable company such as pay pal should remove immediately and or make VERY clear what the nature of the pop up window is. 

I kindly request that pay pal remove any and all request for credit off my credit report. 

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

310616,Debt collection,"The disputed account has been given ample time to validate their position of maintaining a collection account on my personal credit profiles. It is now time that I request a division of the Federal Trade Commission known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to demand accountability.

I work a seasonal job and earned very little XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, just barely enough to cover my rent, car and food. Navient, who now services my loans, is telling me there are no options for postponing or reducing my payments, so after years of paying on time and working hard to make payments worth hundreds of dollars every month to this company, they have no options for me except to just become late on my payments, be charged late fees, and have damaging information added to my credit report even though I have taken the time to contact them for help. 
It absolutely brings me to tears to think that all of my hard work to try to improve my life has just ended me as an indentured servant. I would n't be able to qualify to buy a home, or be able to afford having a child, let alone dream of saving for retirement. 
It seems like after having this monkey on my back and already struggling for 12 years, there should be some other option for me than bad credit reports."

On my last phone call supervisor XXXX advised me that Transunion is having issues with their on-line service and that comments ca n't be added due to technical issues. he advised me to call back and that they would add my comments over the phone which i think is rediculous. i just want to correct my incorrect credit information and i have spent 2 hours doing something that should only take 15 minutes, and it 's still not resolved. I attached my complete and condensed version for your information in case you can forward either one to TransUnion. the edited version is what i tried to attach to their on-line service due to their character limit."
361485,Payday loan,"A few weeks ago I had a an overdraft fee from first Virginia, I called them to ask why they 'd taken so much from my account. I do recall setting up an ACH auth in XX/XX/2010 but this time they took too much, and last week took another payment which caused ANOTHER NSF. The problem is I 'd filed a complaint with a manager about how the collections specialist and team supervisor was rude. A few days after that, I set up a payment arrangement with another rep for XX/XX/XXXX yet they took the money several days sooner even though I was only 3 days late. I think it was a form of retaliation and shady collection practices. I called my local branch and was advised the collections dept should not have taken a payment when I had a payment arrangement set up."

Since that call I have not received any letter. Just been receiving continuous calls from XXXX to XXXX Monday through Sunday on multiple numbers. When I spoke to one representative I guess they do n't annotate the call and I get atleast 8 to 10 more calls after. Another issue is that they have n't sent me the paperwork I requested and said that the XXXX paperwork will be DENIED automatically. This harassment must stop I told them many times if I could work to pay it off I would but I am a XXXX veteran who is still dealing with medical issues.

During the call I ask if she could relook at my account to see my options again about being on the rate reduction plan. I asked informative questions and with getting minimal response back I asked her to explain in more detail and to help me better understand. The amount of the payment plan had increased from last year and she stated that the interest rate would not change from last year. But mathematically it was not adding up so I asked her to please explain in detail, to have me better understand the break down. Eventually she became overly aggressive. After several times of stating that I was not trying to frustrate her I was just trying to get clarity her aggression heightened. She then with anger told me that she was getting her supervisor to speak to me. I restated that there was no need to be aggressive and her response : "" I am not being aggressive you 're just not accepting my answers. '' Again her "" answers '' were not informative. XXXX of her "" answers '' during the call when I asked her to verify the breakdown she claimed that the private lender can "" change how they do things simply because!

The call was unprofessional and my questions regarding my private loans still remain unanswered."

Through your dispute system I recently filed a dispute stating that someone with a similar name had filed this public record and it was not mine. Unfortunately it came back verified and it is still listed on my credit report. Frustrated I decided to contacted the Bankruptcy Court and they informed me that they do not provide anyone with a debtor 's full social security number, and they do not provide any credit bureau any information relating to any bankruptcy cases. As you well know it is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act to report erroneous information on a credit report. I ask that you remove it immediately. How is this information verified and where. There was a wrong SSN listed on my report at one time, so it is possible that additional information could in fact be in correct. I had to resend the letter, twice to the credit bureau. Both time they denied receiving it. In addition, the court clerk told all bankruptcy information is only available third party and they do not have all the information in the file because it is a sealed file. My home is a rental and I still receive mail from pass tenants. I believe this is not factual and should be removed from my credit report."

I filled out the application XX/XX/XXXX, was granted the account, and fulfilled all other terms required to meet the promotion. I realized that I never received the promotional money while filling out taxes this year and contacted Discover, only to hear that I was n't eligible for the promotion because I was n't 'targeted. ' No one can explain why I got a letter when I was n't one of these targeted people, not to mention that getting a credit card is a pretty obvious trigger for targeting for other business. At this point I ca n't produce the original letter since I clean my house more than once every four months and ( clearly stupidly ) assumed that a company which claims to be ranked very high in customer satisfaction would actually meet their commitments so I did n't scan everything, but at the very least the information needs to be out that that Discover is sending promotions to potential customers and then declaring them ineligible even after the customers fulfill their side of the deal."

This is not right. They are required to offer me several options to avoid foreclosure but all of these are unavailable to me if they refuse to return my calls.

86810,Credit card,"I 've had this Bank of America credit card since XXXX. This is the ONLY card that my wife and I have that does not have the ability to setup payments online to pay the minimum payment each month automatically. Instead, it requires that you declare a payment amount to make automatically each month. Since we did n't use this card often, years ago, I set it to pay {$50.00} per month believing that it would easily cover the minimum payment and then some if we did decide to use it. For literally years that assumption held true. This XXXX, purchases were made that resulted in the minimum payment being greater than the {$50.00} that was setup previously. As soon as I realized the problem, unfortunately in XXXX of XXXX, I payed the overdue balance, and contacted Bank of America to attempt to have my credit report corrected based on several limitations on their part : First, we NEVER received supplementary contact to indicate a problem. It is true that I did sign up of paperless statements in XXXX, and I routinely do not check those statements because I rarely use the card. If there were a problem, I had expected Bank of America, like ALL of my other creditors do, to attempt to contact me to indicate such. NO phone calls or letters were received to indicate a problem with the account. 
Second, this is the ONLY account that we have that does not have an option to pay the minimum payment each month on their online bill payment system. Coupled with a lack of communication from the Bank, it would seem to me that this situation was engineered to make money for the Bank through the generation of late payment and over limit fees. 
I submitted requests to Bank of America several weeks ago to make the requested adjustments to my credit report given my exemplary history with them spanning a decade, the above described limitations, and my immediate payment to bring the account current on the day that the problem was finally brought to my attention. When I called today to follow up on the issue, I was notified that my request was denied. I asked them to reconsider my request, and to escalate my request beyond the department that had made the decision to deny my request and was told that was not possible. At that point I cancelled my account with Bank of America and notified them at the same time that I would be making a formal complaint with the appropriate consumer protection agencies."

She was incredibly rude and treated me like a criminal when I am in fact sending payments, just not the full amount. She made me feel awful and embarrassed. And this all happened at work, so everyone could overhear me defending myself, then arguing with the woman and finally crying.

When I received my loan statement for the following month I noticed the error and past due amount and made a branch payment for the past due amount. The lender had contacted the salesman that I purchased the car from to have him contact me to get a payment status. When the salesman contacted me I asked why they were contacting him and not me directly and I explicitly told the salesman that I did not want him communicating with the lender on my behalf that I would contact them directly.

She threatened me that my loan was under review and they they were going to stop servicing my loan. She also informed me that they had contacted the dealership and all XXXX contacts that they made me list on my loan application regarding the past due balance on my loan. I informed her that the only person that I have authorized to discuss my loan with was myself and that they did not have authorization to contact the dealer or any contact on my loan application regarding my loan. She countered that they do in fact have the legal right to contact anyone they wanted to in regards to status of my loan.

204020,Mortgage,"This issue has dragged out over the last 8 months. I have been trying to apply for a Home Loan modification from NationStar Mortgage. I have come under several financial set backs in the 2015 year and wanted to request that I get assistance with my loan. I have applied for several Home Loan Modifications and Appeals with NationStar Mortgage Company, but all were denied. I have had poor customer service from NationStar, and I have requested several times to have a different Loan Specialist assigned to me for the one that was appointed to me would never answer her phone or return my emails. She would call me back at minimum a week later and at that time would explain that I still need to upload more documents for my modification. It was not clear on what documents that I needed and I was referred to the website that would tell me what I need. I have tried contacting her manager in regards to this matter to request someone that would better assist me with my process, but each time I am redirected to her. I have given all the pertinent documents that they have requested online. I received a letter from NationStar stating that I make enough money and was denied any kind of modification assistance. At this time, I have yet to speak with anyone that can offer me any real help and I am not able to speak with anyone that is actually performing the hardship loan. I have tried calling my Loan Specialist every time and she insists that I still have documents that need uploaded. After I upload the documents, I am told to wait and call back a week later to see what they have decided. The loan documents are expiring because I am waiting on NationStar to give me an answer. When I call, I am directed to the customer service center, which has no record of the modification assistance and I am needing to explain again as to why I am calling and why I am requesting assistance with my home loan. I get calls at least 2 to 3 times a week asking when I am going to bring my loan current when all the while I am waiting to hear something from their company. Their one offer to help was for me to pay an amount a month that I am unable to make and there was no other alternative extended. I want the harassment to stop and I would like to move forward with this."
601472,Credit reporting,"I have been in over a 6 month battle between Equifax AND a student consolidation loan company called XXXX but appearing on my credit file as XXXX. I first started looking into my credit report about 7 months ago just be to be curios on where I stand on credit, well as I was looking I was in shock to see that my student loans that were fully discharged by the Dept. Of Education where still reporting as a collections since the approved discharge XX/XX/XXXX which clearly states in the "" Ability to Benefit '' approval letter that all loans that are associated with this student loan discharge will be removed from all XXXX credit reporting agencies, so when I seen that all that time had passed with no update to my credit reports what so ever I immediately started disputing them with Equifax , XXXX and XXXX. I have a Premium membership with Equifax from cases of identity theft so I could constantly monitor everything on my credit and view my updated credit report unlimitedly. At first when I would dispute XXXX XXXX now called XXXX I was having a bit of a problem even after submitting many many documents but finally within a few weeks of my persistence they finally totally removed the collections from them. But yet I had another company to tackle that I was disputing at the same time I was XXXX XXXX and that is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 's they are reporting on my credit reports in collections but with a {$0.00} balance, and it is very negatively impacting my credit score. You can see on Equifax when I log on that I have disputed XXXX over 20 times and the results of Equifax investigation would ALWAYS be the same despite ALL the paperwork and proof they would possible need to verify I no longer owe that debt and that Dept. of Education clearly stated on the letter to approve me that they where to ALL be REMOVED not to just be updated not to just add a remark and still leave in in collections to completely REMOVE all student loans associated with the discharge which included the company XXXX, after me and XXXX going back to back with my disputes for MONTHS ( I would dispute, they would leave it the same ) over and over again, I finally got fed up and directly called this company ans demanded to speak with a manager her name was XXXX I explained to her everything I am explaining here and that her company is inaccurately reporting me in collections when they should be REMOVED entirely which says so by the Dept. Of Education themselves, at first she was very persistent that I was wrong that they will NOT remove the XXXX accounts from them I have in collections and that was pretty much that and just wait the 7 years for it to fall off, I was furious I knew there were laws against this so I threatened to report her company and then we both hung up the phone, Not even 20 minutes later she called me back to admit that I was RIGHT indeed that she had spoke with her manager and everything I was saying was true. Before I even called them I even sent them about XXXX different documents of evidence of my student loan discharge thinking for sure they would have no doubts, but turned out THEY DID. To date XX/XX/XXXX I have sen them over XXXX faxes called about XXXX to XXXX times only to be told the same answer over and over again "" we submitted all tradelines to be completely removed from your credit report electronically ''. After I kept hearing that for weeks but still no update even after they had correspondence with Equifax on XX/XX/XXXX which is AFTER the "" electronic notification '' why did it not update then?! I also blame this on Equifax the point of a dispute is to investigate the account reporting information is accurate and to validate the debt, obviously they did not do a thorough investigation over 20 TIMES or this would have been resolved, after showing them proof every time of the discharge as well as I did XXXX."
259868,Mortgage,"As of XXXX XXXX, 2015, my mortgage was transferred from XXXX over to Seterus. XX/XX/XXXX, I received my transfer letter from XXXX stating everything I needed to know and that I should expect a welcome letter from Seterus shortly. Today is XXXX XXXX, 2015, and I have yet to receive my welcome letter, which reading the FTC website they must send me by XX/XX/XXXX. I called Seterus this evening and got the runaround, now keep in mind that I am new to them and they already are treating me this way. I 've read a ridiculous amount of complaints about this loan servicing company, but now I 've actually experienced it. I recorded the entire phone call, so that you can hear exactly what the representative, XXXX, said and how she dodged questions I asked. She just kept putting me on hold. I informed her that I was recorded the conversation and then it got a little hostile. She put me on hold again, where after a few more minutes of holding a gentleman that referred to himself as XXXX XXXX came on the line and began yelling at me about recording the call before he swiftly hung up on me. Now, can you explain how this kind of business behavior is acceptable? I got no information about my new loan, no information on how to make a mortgage payment, no loan number, absolutely nothing aside from vagueness and rudeness. These people have a duty to me the homeowner and they are not doing what they are supposed to do. Merely XXXX Seterus and you will see this is a SEVERE problem that nothing is being done about. This is my life, the lives of my children, my home, and I can not fathom that this kind of behavior would be acceptable by any standards. I have contacted XXXX, as they are the holder of my loan, to inform them of the problem. A woman by the name of XXXX informed me that XXXX is, indeed aware of these practices by Seterus and no action has been taken. Once again, I have this phone call recorded with her admission XXXX has been apprised of this issue. There have been over XXXX complaints to the XXXX, yet this company is still somehow allowed to continue their shady practices and downright fraudulent activity. The way they treated me was like my toddler putting his hands over his ears because he does n't want to listen, Seterus does not want to listen to legitimate problems. I 'm contacted absolutely every entity I possibly can to make everyone aware of this situation and compiling a journal of everything, emails, call logs, recordings, complaints filed, everything, and looking into contacting an attorney. Somebody has to do something aside from tell me, "" Oh, we 'll look into it '', and this foolishness continue. Seterus has legal obligations to me, as the servicer of my loan, and I ca n't imagine this is how they are upheld. Again, I am not the only person saying something about this company, so why does nobody take action? Maybe if it was your home, your life, it would be different. It seems as though nobody cares about the homeowners, we have no voice. We are being pushed and bullied, we turn to the organizations that regulate companies like this and are met a lack of empathy or care. I need help, this is just not okay."

When I asked why they replied my funds were n't certified or something to that effect. I contacted them again about my payments being returned and they said my loan modification was still being processed ( mind you I 've been approved and made my trial payments ). I recieve a letter stating my modification was disapproved ( mind you I 've already been approved last year ) I contact them again, I revieve a letter saying there is "" an issue with my mortage title that will not allow me into the program. I contact them to inquire what the issue is with my title so I can straighten it out, I then recieve a letter saying my appeal is being reviewed. 
I never appealed an application which was approved. How could I have been approved last year with an issue with my mortgage title? How can I be disapproved for a program I 've been approved for and have not missed making a timely payment since then?

There has been an ongoing review of the mistake made by OCWEN on my escrow balande owed.

At this time, they are sending me DELINQUENT NOTICES for my mortgage payments and have arranged for a company to call my home as they believe I 'm having problems PAYING MY MORTGAGE. I have paid each and every payment on time and early without fail. Since they reduced the amount to put to escrow to $ XXXX+/- and I HAVE PAID IT IN FULL with 2 pmts of $ XXXXea in XXXX and an additional of {$2500.00} in XXXX, they have not caught up with their own paperwork and show me delinquent! I appreciate all the assistance and contacts you have made for me during this time. I have asked them to ACKNOWLEDGE THE {$3500.00} paid to the escrow ONLY as noted on my checks and they are not doing so and also I asked for a review of the payments to continue with and get double talk responses in the mail and email. 
1. They wanted $ XXXX+/- for the escrow balance and THEY RECEIVED IT 2. They will not respond with acknowledgement that the money WAS INDEED RECEIVED nor give me the amount they would like to adjust my payments to from XXXX IF ANY is required since the {$3500.00} paid already. 
I continue to pay the original amount XXXX and am now receiving the new DELINQUENT NOTIFICATION. It seems that they can not address the challenges THEY created in a timely fashion and I am suffering with possible credit score issues and always the possibility of losing my home when I HAVE PAID CONSISTENTLY and given them the adjusted amount they determined ( {$3500.00} ) after knowing that the nearly {$30000.00} they were looking for originally was NOT VALID! Please request that I get JUST THE INFORMATION I NEED and that they adjust THEIR RECORDS to acknowledge all they have asked me for is COMPLETE and what amount I should be paying on my monthly payment. The new amount they are looking for is around {$5000.00} for no reason but that they can not adjust their own records to make good.

She puts me on hold and then tells me I must talk to a loan specialist and one will return my call within 72 hours. 72 hours comes and goes and no answer. 
I have been nothing but polite and cooperative during this process as I know how lucky I am to have be in a position to rehabe my loans. But now what? Nobody will return my calls. I have to make my payments. I want to make my payments. I will continue making my payments but I also want Performant to honor the contract to which we agreed.

354284,Credit card,"This complaint is not an acknowledgement of the debt, and is not an indication that payment will be made. The goal of this complaint is to bring forth a FCRA violation by XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Citicards ( original creditor ) and XXXX ( or XXXX ; collection agency ). 
I currently have a {$6400.00} collection from XXXX XXXX ( aka XXXX ) illegally appearing on my credit reports. The Original Creditor of this account is Citicards. Upon reviewing my ENTIRE statement history from Citicards ( attached ) it is clear that the date of first delinquency of this account is on or before XXXX XXXX. By the XXXX XXXX report, the available credit limit was {$0.00} - in other words, my credit had been REVOKED, as the account was in serious delinquency. This date explains why the Citi tradeline does not appear in any of my credit reports. However, the XXXX XXXX tradeline appears since it misrepresents the date of first delinquency. Based on the date of first delinquency of XXXX XXXX, the tradeline should appear on my credit reports until XXXX XXXX. I am writing to request that the credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) immediately delete this tradeline. I am also writing to request Citicards ( as required by law ; and as the original creditor ) to instruct the credit unions and XXXX XXXX to stop reporting this tradeline. I am also writing to require XXXX XXXX to immediately stop reporting this tradeline."

I initiated the transfer, through my FirstMerit website account, on XXXX XXXX. The money was debited from XXXX on XXXX XXXX. But, FirstMerit wo n't make it available to me until XXXX XXXX. In other words, they are getting the benefit of a four day float. I do most of my financial stuff on line, and I know that FirstMerit had my money on the XXXX ( everyone else, banks, credit cards, creditors, etc. manages to do same day transactions ). so, my complaint is that FirstMerit Bank is harming me by hanging on to my money for four days without justification. I can of course provide bank statements and documents to support these assertions. And, I have now observed this pattern repeatedly, as i have been making transfers for several months now and every one follows the same pattern."
641982,Credit card,"I took out a Wells Fargo "" Home Rebate '' credit card to help supplement the payments to my mortgage with Wells Fargo. Their product description can be summarized in this way : Purchasing goods/services with the credit card will automatically add "" points '' and said points will be converted into dollars that are deducted automatically from the principle of your mortgage. The product worked as described. HOWEVER : In less than 6 months, Wells Fargo sold my mortgage, rendering the card useless to me. 

Then, without consulting me or without gaining my permission - they simply changed the type of credit card I had. I went to a local branch and was told "" There is nothing you can do about it '' - Basically the company scammed me by letting me take out the card and then as soon as I had a significant balance on it sold my mortgage to avoid me saving hundreds if not thousands of dollars through use of the card over time."

The final straw was a fake check that was allowed to be cashed and the horrible way in which it was handled in order to have the money replaced. It was a substantial amount and until the police became involved, I was getting resistance from Wells to put the money back even though they admitted that the check was fake, not written or approved by me, and that it may have been an inside job."
371448,Mortgage,"We currently have a home equity balloon XXXX mortgage with BMO Harris Bank. We have paid this loan for 10 years and we have never been late or missed a payment until this point. XXXX XXXX lost his job XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX also is not working. As a result of our financial difficulties we could not pay the new balloon payment which went into effect XX/XX/XXXX. When we took out the home equity loan we were lead to believe that if we were unable to pay the balloon payment amount the loan would be re-set to interest only as long as we were current in our payments. 
BMO Harris purchased our loan from XXXX. We contacted the BMO Mortgage Dept. to see if the loan could be refinanced. BMO Mortgage informed us that because our credit had eroded due to our current financial difficulties that there was nothing they could do and referred us to the BMO Loss Mitigation Department. At the time our loan was not delinquent. The BMO Loss Mitigation Dept. informed us that there was nothing they could do because the loan was current. They went on to say that only after we were delinquent could they work with us on a solution and loan modification. They also went on to say that our credit score was going to be negatively impacted because they were going to report us as late to the credit reporting agencies. 
We have been working with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They are a HUD certified mortgage housing counselor. ( Attachment ) XXXX advised us to first work out a plan with the XXXX mortgage holder and then work with the XXXX mortgage holder. XXXX recommended that approach based on the fact that we could not commit to a payment plan on the XXXX mortgage when we did not know what our XXXX mortgage payment would be. As a second mortgage holder we told BMO that we were first trying to work out something with the XXXX mortgage company before dealing with the BMO XXXX mortgage because until we knew what our first mortgage payment was going to be it was not possible to commit to a payment plan with BMO that we might not be able to maintain. ( Attachment ) However BMO has not been sincere in trying to help us with a XXXX mortgage modification. After we got a loan modification from our first mortgage holder we notified BMO and they filed a "" Notice of Foreclosure ''. ( Attachment ) BMO is not working with us in an honest manner. They are continuing with a foreclosure while making unreasonable documentation requests within a limited time frame. ( Attachment ) The foreclosure notice was only sent to us and our condo association. Sending the foreclosure notification to our condo association was not a legal requirement on the part of BMO. They notified our condo association of the foreclosure in order to embarrass and intimidate us. We think BMO is using fear and intimidation toward us because we are XXXX, XXXX and have a large amount of equity in our home. BMO Harris wants to railroad us into foreclosure with a minimum amount of effort toward modifying our XXXX mortgage even though we had an excellent 10 year history in the past."

She then indicated they would process the dispute and notify the credit bureaus and XXXX. I need to have this removed from credit report immediately. The XXXX rep stated that XXXX would have sent the erroneous info to XXXX with my name and address. XXXX does not look up anyone 's address/contact info. I have no accts with XXXX so I do n't see this as a glitch in their billing system. I have no idea how XXXX got my name. I 've never had a comcast account and have no idea why they would link XXXX XXXX 's accounts to me. I 've tried to get someone at XXXX to address this and after numerous waits and transfers between collections, billing, etc. they will only refer me to a website to complete a form that I then have to get notarized and send to them. Absolutely ridiculous. It is clear that these are not my accounts and the burden of proof ( and hopefully law ) should require XXXX to rectify this immediately. There must be some regulation around tagging fraudulent information to an individual. It 's clear there are some unscrupulous practices occurring at XXXX. How they tied my name/address to this person 's deliquent accounts should be investigated. Also their practice to require the consumer to complete a fraud report and get it notarized is an inconvienence that I as the victimized consumer should not have to endure. This issue is impacting my ability to secure a loan for a significant financial transaction which will cause me a financial hardship if not completed. This has placed a blemish on my credit history despite the fact that it will eventually be removed. I will seek damages if this inaccurate information causes me to lose this financial opportunity for which the loan is for. Someone needs to investigate to determine if this is a widespread practice at XXXX."

Ironically, my XXXX installment, which I paid 23 days late in XXXX ; was beyond my control & I disclosed the reason why. ( My bank account/debit card number had been compromised in XXXX, IN. @ a XXXX 's & I had to obtain an alternate debit card ) I asked XXXX, an acting Manager, if she could provide a copy of the agreement that I signed & send it to my email address so I could CONFIRM AND VERIFY that this action that had taken place by them was LEGAL. I also stated to her that my copy of my contract/lien agreement that I signed, was located in the rear pocket, directly behind the driver 's seat. She originally stated that she would ; then when I had n't received anything, within a timely-fashion ( an HOUR ), I became uneasy & curious & therefore, I called back. When I spoke back to XXXX, she then stated that she did n't have access to my file and would n't be able to send a copy of my contract. I questioned that since she was handling the duties of the Manager in their absence. Long story shortened, She was very rude and unresponsive to several inquiries. 1. ) How much would it NOW take to retrieve my vehicle? 2. ) How could I retrieve my personal belongings? *Since my WORK ID and uniform was currently in the vehicle. * XXXX, In addition, I am a XXXX XXXX & I am so grateful and fortunate that I had taken my Personal equipment out of my vehicle ; because I mainly work on the weekends, and I still had XXXX XXXX to do ; which would have been LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to fulfill ; based upon the inability to retrieve my PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

Even when she disclosed to XXXX that we had the money to obtain the vehicle back, she was then told that we had to make an appointment and be scheduled in order to complete that action ; because the vehicle was not in their possession.???? I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED such UNPROFESSIONALISM and SHEER RUDE BEHAVIOR, nor have I had a FINANCE COMPANY REPOSSESS MY VEHICLE ; in less than 30 days from non-payment.

Upon reviewing that document, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC LIMITATION/RESTRICTION that denotes that they may repossess the vehicle IN THAT short amount of time granted.

On a separate loan, also with NJCLASS, has been placed in default and sent to a collection agency. The collection agency has been unprofessional and difficult to deal with. They have refused several requests by me of a itemized accounting of the monies paid to them by me. The next thing I recieved was a copy of a motion for judgement filed with the court. Shortly afterwards, I recieved a letter of which I was copied on requesting the court to withdraw their motion. When I attempt to communicate with them they treat me awful and threaten me with various types of actions, yet when I request documents they blatantly refuse to provide me with anything. I no longer feel comfortable sending payments that they can not provide an accounting for. I have contacted the NJCLASS and they have n't been able to provide any assistance regarding this issue. During the initial period of which they claimed to have mail bills and contact me regarding a potential default I lived a multiple addresses while trying to find permanent housing. It 's highly probable that if they did send me notifications I did not recieve them because I was without a permanent address for several months. I still am perplexed that while I maintained payments on the other loan, that they would have not been able to communicate that my other loan was in jeopardy, as I called in and those payments were made by phone."

I asked why and she stated they are not allowed to provide that info. I stated I do know XXXX XXXX and can not provide his personal info without knowing why. I replied send him a letter. She stated we have done that. I replied no you have not and hung. I find it odd that this company has my phone number ( which I have had for only a few years ) and they do not have his phone number ( which he has had for almost ten years. We have never done business with this company and we do not have any outstanding debts that would be transferred to them. I am concerned this is a SCAM."

Upon looking into things, I noticed there is a bankruptcy on my credit reports with information that does not make sense. I imagine no one would ever have a bankruptcy for {$0.00}. I then went to the credit reporting agency Experian and sent them a letter to fix this information. After doing so I went to the local county clerks office to see what information they give out to the reporting agencies that ask for it. I was informed that they do not talk to the reporting agencies at all. This confused me because when I looked on my report it said that the dispute of the bankruptcy was investigated and they found it to be all correct. If they do not go down to the clerk 's office at the court or at least call and find out all applicable information then the investigation was not done and they have broken the law. In addition the incorrect information is still on my credit report and I am unable to qualify for any credit products which is making it impossible for me to eventually buy a home. I need the information in my credit file to be correct, and I need Experian to do the job they are required to do by law or remove the incorrect backruptcy off my credit file. Please help because talking to Experian directly has proven to be futile."

485466,Mortgage,"My mortgage loan through Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC was going along fine until XX/XX/XXXX. At this time, due to an incentive bonus payment through my HAMP loan modification, a portion of my loan referred to as "" interest Bearing Principal Balance -- in the amount of {$3300.00} gets paid off early. ( Attachment XXXX ). It is at this point in time that a chain of events have happened causing me great concern. 

The date of XX/XX/XXXX becomes the due date in Ocwen 's system no matter when I pay to escrow. ( Attachment XXXX ) Then I am no longer able to pay online on their website. Ocwen tells me to pay through the mail. Checks get returned to me with a notice that my loan is in default Attachment XXXX ) ( except for the tiny print at the bottom saying if debt has been discharged through bankruptcy ( which it was XX/XX/XXXX ), this is not an attempt to collect ) .I make numerous phone calls to Ocwen complaining that they will not accept my escrow payments even though the contract indicates that Ocwen provide an escrow account for me. ( attachment XXXX ) Feeling I have no alternative, I write a letter to escrow dept at Ocwen requesting that they de-escrow my account. ( attachment XXXX ). I had to send the letter twice because Ocwen stated they never received my letter. My understanding is that the letter has now been received. That is good, but I need for the de-escrowing process to become completed and subsequently the amount in my escrow of {$540.00} returned to me. 

Next issue is regarding unpaid property tax installment of {$1000.00} that was due on XX/XX/XXXX was NEVER PAID BY OCWEN. They paid the first installment due on XX/XX/XXXX but not the second. I started to get notices from XXXX XXXX that my property could be sold in a tax sale. The total amount if paid after XX/XX/XXXX is {$1000.00}. ( attachment XXXX ) Ocwen needs to acknowledge their mistake and send me a refund check for {$1000.00}. 

Repeated calls and emails to Ocwen get me nowhere. On XX/XX/XXXX I pay the second installment myself. ( attachment XXXX ) even though Ocwen was supposed to pay it. Ocwen keeps saying they paid my taxes, but their tax/accounting dept erroneously paid only the first installment ( attachment XXXX ) They think they paid my taxes, but it appears to me ( and XXXX County ) that they paid the first installment + added in an old amount from the previous year and marked it as paid! ( probably {$1000.00} + {$1000.00} = {$2000.00} ) ( attachment XXXX ) duh At this point, Ocwen needs to send me a check for {$1000.00} to fulfill their escrow obligation. Ocwen also needs to complete the de-escrow process for my account. Ocwen seems unequipped to service my account adequately. They need to accurately deal with the terms of my loan modification, make corrections in their system so that my account is not treated as in default when, in fact, it is not. This has gone way too far!!! I just received a 30 grace period notice. I am scared. Ocwen needs to fix this problem!. Or what? Will they try to foreclose on an erroneus amount from XXXX of {$200.00} that really is n't due?. Or maybe the {$86000.00} that has been deferred until XX/XX/XXXX? Which all seems irrelevant because of my bankrupcty discharge. When will this stop? Now, please!!!!"

341816,Bank account or service,"Bank of America has a wire transfer glitch when the phone is the same on both accounts. On Tuesday morning, XX/XX/2017, I went to transfer money from my personal account to my new business account at the local Bank of America on XXXX in XXXX, TN. I stopped to ask the front attendants what was the maximum amount I could transer without a hold on a personal check. XXXX, a banking associate, invited me to her office to show me how to link my business account to my personal account on online banking and how to make the transfer easier. She called an online banking specialist to facilitate that. As she waited on the phone, she showed me how to make a transfer on my mobile phone. I did as she said -- step by step. She instructed me as she watched my every move. I could n't remember my new business account email, so she had me transfer through my mobile phone number. I have only one phone number, so it 's the same for both my personal and business accounts. In the Add Recipent form boxes, I wrote in my business name and my phone number. She led me through the process of sending money to my business. I first tried {$12000.00} and it showed a message that the maximum allowed was {$2500.00}. So, I entered {$2500.00} and pressed the button to execute the transer. I received a text to my phone with a confirmation number and the money came out of my personal account, BUT the money did not arrive to my business account. So, the banking associate called to find out what happened to the money and the call wait was too long. So, she made a physical transfer and I called Bank of America customer service from home. I spoke with several people and finally with a "" money mover. '' After a few questions, he said the money had been sent to someone I had transferred to in the past. I have never transferred money from my bank account to anyone. He said that the money went to whomever had my phone number before me. I have had my same phone number since XX/XX/XXXX. He said he would make a claim and took the information. On Wednesday morning, XX/XX/2017, I went to the banking associate, XXXX, and we spoke with several people on the phone including what they called "" digital. '' The "" money mover '' had never made the claim he mentioned. After all, she said that they could not submit a claim because the transfer had "" cleared. '' After almost XXXX hours on the phone, the banking associate, XXXX, said that they would open an investigation and email me later on Wednesday. It is now Wednesday night, XX/XX/2017 at XXXX and I still have no idea where my money went and when I will get it back. Even with the banking associate explaining her involvement in this transfer glitch, Bank of America has not given me access to my money. They do n't know where it went. I just do n't think it 's fair that I have to wait for them to figure it out. It is their fault that that money did not come back to my phone number on both accounts. It is also not fair that the "" money mover '' made excuses. They say that they ca n't tell me where my money went, because of some privacy law. All I know is that I followed her instructions, she watched me the entire time, she even waited for XXXX hours on the phone and vouched that it was her mistake, and regardless of all the effort, I 'm the only one affected by this loss of time and money."

My account in question had been paid in full, I did not take a settlement offer and paid the whole amount that was due on the account. When I had checked the other XXXX credit reporting sites this information had not been updated on my account. Upon reading information on XXXX website I found this statement, "" If information in your credit report is changed by your lender as a result of a dispute, federal law requires the lender to notify any other consumer reporting company to which it reported the information. So if it is reported on all XXXX credit reports, it should be updated on all XXXX credit reports ''. Because this was not done, As of today XX/XX/XXXX have initiated disputes with XXXX and XXXX.

Conveniently, the message arrived after the amount was transferred, and consequently, no opportunity to dispute. 
The 6-month interest free plan is misleading and deceptive, and the withdrawal of the remaining amount owing that was not authorized is nothing short of theft.

706216,Credit card,"I have attempted numerous times to resolve this issue with Capital One. I have used their chat system, phone system, and direct mail requesting attention to and correction of the issue at hand. I am submitting this complaint as a last resort. 

I opened the Capital One Mastercard at hand on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Several years ago I put the card aside in favor of another, leaving the account open paper statements and automated payments on, in case any charge was incorrectly billed, or a statement not received. I have not used the card in over 3 years. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX a charge of {$11.00} was erroneously submitted to my Capital One Mastercard. I was never alerted to the charge, never received a statement reflecting the charge, mailed or electronic, for the month it was billed, or the next. Capital One nonetheless added a late payment charge to my account, and then another, plus interest, while failing to send a statement or alert that there was a balance on the account. I received no phone call, email, or other contact. My contact information is and was correct and up to date. Similarly, my account had automatic payments setup to avoid such a situation, and no automatic payment was submitted or applied. I only learned of the balance from a credit monitoring service after Capital One reported negative information on my credit report. 

I take my credit, reported information, and scores very seriously. I am vigilant about paying my bills and always paying on time. I have XXXX negative items on my credit reports, that is, until XXXX XXXX, when Capital One incorrectly reported the above as a missed payment, to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 

Even after being alerted to their error, Capital One refuses to do anything to correct the mistake. In fact they act intentionally to reaffirm the information they report, without reviewing that it is correct. 

Filing a dispute with the CRAs is useless. Capital One 's nvestigations into disputes are automated, include no human review, and rely solely on the self-reinforcing data they have previously provided. No actual verification takes place. Blanket, automated confirmations sent in response to disputes. Investigations and review of their responsibilities to furnish accurate and complete information are instant, and even take place on weekends and holidays during which Capital One business offices are closed. 

Capital One does not take seriously or respond to requests for review, completely disregarding their responsibilities and requirements as a furnisher of data to consumer reporting agencies. They have XXXX regard for the devastating financial and personal harms they have caused by incorrectly reporting negative information. 

I want to close my accounts and sever any and all relationships I have with Capital One, but am afraid that if I am to close my account they will never fix this issue. It is for this reason I turn to submitting a dispute, in the hope that the error is corrected on my credit report, and that Capital One does not continue doing this to others."

They have been deceitful, dishonest, and unprofessional in the manner that they have handled this issue from day one. I feel that the only course of action is to file a civil suit which my attorneys have drafted up and will present with my signed petition on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I am tired of dealing with this company and this issue. I will also be filing a complaint with the Attorney General as it is within my rights. They have made this process long and hard. I have also provided proof that they deleted the items from XXXX report but not from the other XXXX credit reporting agencies. Also they could not verify definitively that the accounts are mine and that they belonged on my credit. If they were sure they belonged to me, why did they remove them from XXXX credit report ( XXXX ) and not from XXXX or XXXX? This is what I mean by dishonest and unprofesisonal business ethics and practices. They have cost me money in this process of disputing with them and this is getting out of hand. They stated that they have a right to collect but they indeed DO NOT by rights and provisions provided to consumers under FDCPA and FCRA. This harassment and blatant disregard for the law is what is have me want to seek damages from Ad Astra Recovery with filing legal suit against them."
11894,Student loan,"XXXX and Nelnet consistently refused and steered me away from Pay as You Earn and Revised Pay as you Earn programs and instead steered me toward multiple, consecutive forbearances from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. They sited error after error and continue to deny my application and forced me into forbearance repeatedly, adding a fee of {$1000.00} to my loan for each forbearance. In XXXX XXXX sold my loan to Nelnet who continues to deny my application and steer me towards yet another forbearance. My last application for REPAYE through Nelnet was in XX/XX/XXXX, they denied my last application because they said they did not like my pay stub because it does not show pay frequency and they said I also did not qualify because by paying early, I did not make 3 consecutive payments on time. They suggested another forbearance. 

I am trying to avoid foreclosure and bankruptcy and protect my family. I just want my REPAYE application approved so that I can start paying my student loan without losing our home and my sanity."
193521,Mortgage,"Bank of America broke the rules. 
When Bank of America represented to me and bona fide purchasers the subject property is vacant and abandoned, Bank of America, the Trustee, the Trustee Attorney, the servicer, and third party representatives intentionally made false statements during loss mitigation processes including, but not limited to, the modification and foreclosure processes. These knowingly false statements and representations on a mortgage, Deed of Trust, or real property were designed to mislead and deceive in an effort to solicit or gain a desired outcome, action or inaction, or result and are in violation of the California Business and Professions Code. 
I have never abandoned or vacated the subject property and remain in possession, control and occupancy of the subject property to date. 
The XXXX Requirements are as previously stated and are to include the following : Anytime during loss mitigation processes when either party believes Dual Tracking has occurred or may occur, any foreclosure process can only be brought as a judicial foreclosure and no non-judicial foreclosure may be had. 
All previously mentioned resolutions are desired and mandatory."

Until now I do n't have work. But they keep on bugging me. How can I pay them but actually I Paid them the whole amount I owe with interest. But they said I have to pay them until XX/XX/XXXX. That is too much. And I do n't have work how can I pay them. They keep on calling me and sending me email. THey used different number on calling me and this is too much. The company name is XXXX ( payday loan )
148041,Credit reporting,I am a victim of the XXXX XXXX and XXXX data breaches. I requested my free annual credit report from LexisNexis. I also requested that my file have a security freeze placed on it. LexisNexis told me that they are not a credit reporting agency and would not give me a copy of my file or place a freeze on it.
598220,Debt collection,"I took out a pay day loan around XX/XX/XXXX from Ace Check cashing loan. I did not pay it back in the time I was supposed to. Sometime later I kept asking Ace about the debt I owed and they gave me a number to call. I called the number and they said they did n't have anything for me. Around XX/XX/XXXX I opened a bank account with my bank at the time of the payday loan. They said I owed them the money for the payday loan so I paid them back. A couple months ago I tried to get a loan from my bank and they said my credit score was too low so they offered to heal my credit. He looked up one of my credit reports and said I had a delinquent account. I was surprised as I thought I was paying off everything. He said the debt was with a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX. I tried to find a way to contact this name. I found nothing. I let the banker know about this and he emailed me back saying he found a number. I called the number and the man was very rude and unprofessional. I felt like it was a scam and I told him so and I was very wary of giving him my social security number. Unfortunately I did n't record the conversation. Sometime later I got a call from XXXX XXXX, it was pretty early and I do n't remember exactly what he said. I remember telling him that I could n't pay the amount right that second because I have rent coming up. He wanted me to pay the whole amount immediately. I asked for a settlement and he gave me one but still wanted some of the money right away. I told him I would talk to my dad and get it to him in the next week or something like that. He got my email address and sent me an email with a settlement attatched. I put the amount I thought I owed in my budget. The email gave me about tow months to pay the amount off and a specific date by which to pay part of what I thought I owed. He called me a couple weeks later and was pretty vague about why he was calling. I said I do n't owe the partial payment until later in the month, like the XXXX or something and the rest of the settlement is due by XXXX XXXX. I said I 'm driving through a canyon so I 'm about to lose service and then the call was lost and my phone said call failed. He called me again, a week before the payment was due and this time was very rude saying the payment should have been paid already and something about calling me on XXXX XXXX. I did n't have any paperwork with the dates he had given me so I just said you told me the payment was n't due till later. He continued to speak to me loudly and rudely, so I asked to speak with his supervisor. Another guy got on the phone and also said nothing about this being an attempt to collect a debt. I put him on speaker and my dad was there listening for only part of it. I told him I did n't think this was a legit company and that they spelled my name wrong on the email. He also insisted on saying I owed the money now and that the settlement was basically just a favor and was something they were n't required to offer me. He was very rude and I hung up the phone. He sent me an email saying he did n't think I was being harassed. He said he listened to the conversation that was recorded. I hope all my conversations were recorded. He said maybe I was confused because the settlement I had previously received was written wrong. he attatched a new settlement with my first name spelled correctly and my last name added this time. They still have an incorrect address for me and I have not been asked for my address at all at any point. I have not received any thing by mail. I want to pay off all my debt. I want to find out if I owe this debt. I called Ace check cashing today and their collection office has nothing for me."
603879,Bank account or service,"I had a balance of XXXX in my TCF checking account ending in XXXX as of XXXX/XXXX/2015. I made XXXX transactions on XXXX. The last of these was dinner at XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX at XXXX in the evening. When I got home, I checked my balance online and saw that all the XXXX transactions were pending, but I had miscalculated and the last XXXX would overdraw the account by {$18.00}. Wanting to avoid an overdraft fee, I called the bank to attempt to transfer funds into the account, this service was not available, I attempted to find a way to transfer funds into the account online from another bank account, this was not available, finally I drove to the TCF ATM machine that stands in the place they used to have our branch, and found that the TCF ATM does not take deposits. The nearest branch is XXXX miles from my home, by that point it is XXXX at night. The next morning on XXXX I drove to the bank branch XXXX miles away, and gave the teller {$20.00} to deposit into the account and asked the teller to close the account. She stated that she was unable to close the account due to a negative balance. She explained that there were overdraft fees on the account for transactions that were pending. We both agreed that it did n't make sense, but she said she was unable to reverse the charges without manager approval and that the manager was not there and would not be returning that day. Today ( XXXX ) I received a letter in the mail from TCF Bank stating that my account now overdrawn in the amount of {$250.00} as of XXXX/XXXX/15. I have not used the account since and after speaking to the customer service department, I have learned from them that there have been no transactions since those XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/15. They explained to me that each XXXX of those transactions has incurred an overdraft fee. They explained that at XXXX each day, the deposits made before XXXX are added to the account, then any transactions that are posted ( collected by the merchant ) before XXXX are subtracted from the balance and then any transactions that are pending which would be overdrafts are assessed the fee. When I asked them to explain to me specifically how each of my transactions incurred a fee, the customer service team lead named XXXX said "" Ok, let me give you an example. If on Monday morning you had {$100.00} in your account and you make XXXX transactions of {$50.00} each and they are still pending on tuesday morning you make a transaction of {$100.00} your account will have a balance of - {$100.00}. '' When I asked XXXX how many overdraft fees would be assessed on the account, he answered, "" XXXX. '' This is not how I interpret the policy of the bank. Perhaps I am not interpreting it correctly, however, even if it is the policy does allow TCF to charge me XXXX overdraft fees between business days ( after XXXX and before XXXX the next day ) on an {$18.00} overdraft, that spells fraud. Because of a previous complaint I made to the bank, they had explained to me that when a transaction is marked "" pending '' it means that there was a request for authorization to withdraw funds. The explained to me that the transaction is n't marked "" posted '' until the merchant makes request for payment, which sometimes takes days. Additionally, TCF customer service was unable to describe for me how exactly each transaction incurred an overdraft fee. Furthermore, my call was disconnected twice conveniently when it seemed they could not explain something important, like how they get away with charging me a fee when they have not even received a demand for payment from the merchant and why two weeks ago they held my transactions in a pending state for days without charging a fee and only charged a fee after they conveniently posted several transactions on the same day as another transaction came through that would cause all transactions to overdraw, but not those same type transactions incur a fee within hours of authorization."
410828,Debt collection,"This woman from a finance loan company calls my phone 3 to 5 times EACH day. If anyone else answers my cell, she tells them my business, telling people I do n't work, threatening to show up at my home. This is clearly a case of harassment. She has actually showed up at my home. Yes, I do owe a debt, but I 'm 60 days late. I 'm going through bankruptcy, but she still continues to harass me and my family."

I notified Barclay Bank on several occasions that I had no knowledge of a credit account that was showing as charged off on my credit report. they continued to report it as well as sold it to a 3rd party without initiating an investigation. In addition after reporting the account to them no less than 4 times as well as sending them written notification of dispute they continue to give the run around and extend the time of their investigation. I have requesting immediate resolution and have not received any such resolution. I continue to get the run around from Barclays Bank Delaware in my attempts to resolve this matter. The representative have cited incorrect sections of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to justify their actions and treatment of this matter.

503029,Mortgage,"I applied for a loan hardship modification with Caliber Home Loans. The modification approved and I had to sign the agreement and have return to Caliber by XX/XX/XXXX. I signed the agreement and called Calibur Home Loans on XXXX XXXX, spoke with an agent name XXXX XXXX. She stated the modification was approved and is being processed. She stated to call her back by Thursday and once processed I would received a copy of the agreement in the mail once processed. I called back to check on the status of my agreement and spoke with a XXXX agent number XXXX and she stated the modification could not be processed and due to some probate paperwork needed for my deceased mother XXXX XXXX XXXX. She also stated she do not know why the last time I called I was not told this. XXXX days has passed and I received no phone call, no letter from Caliber indicating what was needed. I am the cborr on the loan, and have the only interest in this mortgage. I advised XXXX, why was n't this communicated to me in a timely manner as I am waiting on a decision and would have to take time off work to go to my county office for this information. I am filing a complaint as they failed to communicate the proper info needed in a timely matter. My mod should take effect XXXX XXXX. When I called on XXXX XXXX, I was calling to set up an autopay to make sure the payments are on time each month, but instead I received this communication. furthermore, the interest on this loan is on a simple fee and continued to accumulate dailty. I feel Caliber need to offer some other assistance until I am able to get the documents they are requesting. When I completed my hardship, I received a letter from Caliber indicating they need a death certificate for XXXX XXXX XXXX and this was all they needed. No one mentioned anything about an EOE paper work, which I feel is not needed in this case as I am the cbrr on the loan and have been making payments to them for a while now. Plus, I would like an explanation of the additional charges that was added to my loan after Caliber took over my loan payment from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a permanent interest rate reduction as the interest on this loan is way too high but instead they gave me a 5 year plan reduction on the modification.

446645,Mortgage,"LOAN NUMBER XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX ON XXXX XXXX, XXXX MY LOAN WAS PURCHASED BY CARRINGTON MORTGAGE IN XXXX. FOR THE FIRST 90 DAYS OF MY LOAN, CARRINGTON COULD NOT PROVIDE ME WITH A LOAN NUMBER OR A MEANS BY WHICH TO MAKE MY PAYMENT. WHEN I WAS ABLE TO MAKE A PAYMENT IN THE FOURTH MONTH, CARRINGTON INITIATEED FORCLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ME. 
I WAS ADVISED ON NUMBEROUS OCCASIONS THAT FOR THE FIRST 60 DAYS THERE WOULD BE NO REPORTS MADE TO MY CREDIT BASED ON THE FAILINGS AND SHORTCOMINGS OF CARRINGTON AND THE INABILITY OF THEIR SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE ME AS A CUSTOMER AND THEIR INABILITY TO PROVICE ME WITH A LOAN NUMBER. 
I BELIEVE THIS IS A FORM OF PREDATORY LENDING FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS : 1. A REPORT WAS MADE TO THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY AFTER I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPORT MADE FOR THE FIRST SIXTY DAYS. 
2. THE INTEREST RATE IS MUCH HIGHER THAN A TRADITIONAL FHA INTEREST RATE AT 6.5 % ON A XXXX LOAN ABOUNT 3. I AM NOT UNABLE TO REFINANCE THE LOAN BECAUSE OF THE "" REFER TO FORECLOSURE '' THAT CARRINGTON HAS PLACED ON MY CREDIT ACCOUNT 4.

507321,Credit reporting,I have disputed this bankruptcy with Transunion and also asked for method of verification. They have not given me this information they stated that they verified the information with a third party vendor. Not the bankruptcy courts. I have been to the court to ask for them to show me the information they said that they can not verify information. The clerk told me that they NEVER EVER report anything to the bureaus and they do not verify anything with the bureaus. The credit bureaus are not validating any information with the originator of this said account. A third party is hear say and is not validation. The courts cant and wont produce my signature on any paperwork so i am asking again for them to remove this inaccurate account. Or Send me method of validation with the courts and the name and contact information from this person so that i can dispute directly with that person because this is inaccurate. Third party is not valid.
